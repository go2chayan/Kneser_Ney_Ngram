EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 1 
The sitting is suspended to the call of the Chair . 
Hon. Don Boudria 
Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament . 
The Government will continue to reduce barriers to post - secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program , increased assistance for students with dependents , and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low - and moderate - income Canadians attend university or college . 
In section ( 1 ) of Standing Order 104 , by deleting the word " fourteen " and by substituting therefor the word " sixteen '' ; 
Private trade missions should be encouraged. 
The Liberal government has demonstrated the flexibility and vigour of Canadian federalism . 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
The determination and sportsmanship of the Whitby Warriors are an inspiration to us all . 
* * * 
No , not about me , but that they will never make it . 
Yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word equality even once ; uniqueness , diversity , all kinds of words , but not equality . 
Medicare has suffered and lies wounded. 
Some hon. members : 
The throne speech , despite forward looking language , offers no brilliant illumination of the horizon of the new millennium . 
It marred the 1982 Constitution . 
I do not believe the government is up to that challenge but prove me wrong if I am wrong . 
By investing now in the well - being of today ' s children we are improving the long term social and economic health of our society . 
And yet we knew we had a future . 
Although it is both absurd and disgusting , the reference to the Supreme Court aimed at depriving Quebecers of their right to decide their future democratically is not the real problem . 
A whole generation of our young people finish their studies without being rewarded with a decent job offer and find themselves strapped with a huge debt , $ 25,000 on average . 
In which programs will the government reinvest ? 
Can I make a humble suggestion to him . 
Bill C - 4 . 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau 
Mr. Bill Blaikie 
This is what has happened many times . 
Every $ 1 billion of trade in merchandise creates or sustains 11,000 jobs for Canadian workers . 
That is simply unacceptable . 
The first point I want to make is that when we use the government ' s own projections we find that probably by the year 2001 or 2002 , which would be the end of its mandate , it will have a surplus of approximately $ 14 billion annually . 
It just is not in there . 
There have always been people in the history of francophones in Canada to join those who oppose us , our adversaries , and to diminish us . 
Mr. Paul Mercier ( Terrebonne - Blainville , BQ ) : 
We never agreed to this Constitution . 
It spans three different time zones and the population is roughly 25,000 people . 
I have worked long and hard as the trade critic for our party to try to resolve the European ban on leg - hold traps and products from those traps from entering Europe . 
I am glad my Liberal colleagues here are applauding because this is the throne speech of Brian Mulroney . 
We did it because we care about Canadians . 
Ms. Wasylycia - Leis : 
When we look at language , when we look at law , when we look at culture , there is every reason for the country to embrace the province of Quebec as a distinct society or a unique society , whatever word we want to put on it . 
Mr. Greg Thompson : 
Ms. Sophia Leung ( Vancouver Kingsway , Lib . ) : 
That is wonderful . 
It is for the taxpayers who will be paying the bill for the people on the trip ; the people who pay $ 1,000 a year on average because of trade barriers in Canada . 
CANADA POST CORPORATION 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
On behalf of my party here , our deepest sympathy goes out to Mr. Knowles ' family . 
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the people of Shefford for the confidence they showed in me in the recent federal election . 
This 50:50 split ensures that the Liberal commitments to sound economic planning and to social responsibility will go hand in hand . 
In the near future we will be faced with competition from gambling facilities in the city of Detroit . 
I would like to read a few of the ways the Liberals have spent some of the money so that people can get this into perspective . 
We know that the Liberal Party exists to take and maintain power . 
There are a couple of things I would like to share with the House this afternoon . 
Look at what happened to a former Conservative prime minister . 
What a discovery . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to comment on the speech by the hon. member for Rimouski - Mitis . 
It was beautiful . 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie 
ENVIRONMENT 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 5 
What are they to think when they see pertinent information being withheld from the Canadian Judicial Council , the one body entrusted to ensure that courts and judges remain independent of outside pressures so citizens can rely on the fact that they will receive fair and impartial hearings ? 
I wonder if the member would like to comment on how things like the section 745 hearings have an effect on the people ' s frustration with the justice system . 
I believe this government should and will continue to look after the main interests of society , that being one very important interest . 
She cannot buy patriotism . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
Perhaps what the hon. member - 
I want to ask the Minister of Health , if he cannot even protect the confidentiality of an individual ' s files , how can we be assured he is protecting the health and safety of Canadians ? 
A lawyer by training , Mr. Fraser came from a Liberal family of long standing in his province of birth . 
It also states that parents of young offenders who have contributed to the delinquency of their child can be held responsible for restitution . 
They have participated in town hall meetings on health care , on the environment and on social programs . 
However , I say that we can launch out , guided by love for our country , our community and a sincere concern for our neighbour . 
Either it was not a priority on his personal political agenda or he was overruled. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman : 
Why should we believe in today ' s court judgments when the judges and the juries clearly say this is the penalty that must be applied because of the severity of the crime ? 
Monday , September 29 , 1997 
VOISEY ' S BAY 
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Last year 12 of Canada ' s top thinkers on science and technology were appointed to the Prime Minister ' s Advisory Council on Science and Technology . 
The one item that intrigues me about the Speech from the Throne was the fact that 130 years ago the leaders of this country saw the necessity of a national transportation link . 
After going door to door during the campaign I call Albert County the forgotten land . 
This was what my constituents had accepted as a very real priority . 
We are also giving our students in places like Knowlton , Otterville or Cambridge Bay the same advantages provided by the computer age as students who may be studying in Toronto , Montreal or Vancouver . 
Unlike the 29 proposals found in the throne speech , these are changes that do not cost the government money . 
While the prime minister and the minister of fisheries seem to be so caught up in remaining very friendly with the Americans , our own people are entering financial crisis . 
They are trying to climb back up the cliffs at the Plains of Abraham in their search for their identity , when the place to seek our identity is in what lies around us , in our own experiences , in the people we encounter and in what we do with our lives , not just in wondering what our origins are and who did what . 
Mr. Speaker , another member from the province of Premier Harris , who claims to recognize Quebec as unique in the same way the Pacific salmon is unique . 
It finally acknowledged that British Columbia is unique from the prairie provinces . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , Lucien Bouchard has barely started his sovereignist pilgrimage to France to find symbolic support for his separatist cause and already the truth he refuses to see is hitting him right in the face . 
* * * 
Are they or are they not running businesses by employing personal care givers at home ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I think the hon. member , for whom I have great respect , is being very irresponsible to suggest that there will be an increase in crime . 
They request Parliament to affirm the duty of parents to responsibly raise their children according to their own conscience and beliefs , and to retain section 43 in Canada ' s Criminal Code as it is currently worded. 
The conference is planned as an important step in a process of sharing and discovery aimed at economic recovery in Atlantic Canada . 
In the Speech from the Throne there is a renewed commitment to an activist , independent , internationalist role for Canada in the world community in the tradition of our one time Prime Minister and Nobel peace laureate Lester Pearson whose centenary we celebrate this year . 
The hon. member needs to know that as we enter into the millennium we can do it together . 
People rallied around him and his national party with the deepest conviction . 
Now is it the citizens ' turn to address the issues of the day . 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
The new riding of Erie - Lincoln brings in two fine new areas , the town of Dunnville and the town of Lincoln . 
The member showed some foresight in dealing with many of the issues at stake . 
I believe , as I stated in my speech , that Canada is comprised of peoples from all over the world , gathered together in the country of Canada . 
I would point out to the member that if he truly believes in referendums , then he should not be here because he only got 49 per cent of the vote . 
Introduction and first reading 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Mr. Werner Schmidt 
Some hon. members : 
It has a profound impact on jobs . 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
Mr. Speaker , I did not quite catch what the member said. 
There is absolutely no compassion for the most disadvantaged. 
Statistics Canada showed us in 1992 that 6 percent of the debt is caused by government spending in Canada and only half of that is spending on social programs . 
We know from past experience that the Conservative government tried to balance the budget and in fact started to bring the deficit down and suddenly it turned around and became one of the biggest deficits we ever had . 
My riding of Peace River in Alberta is located in the lowest taxed province in the country . 
The health care system is going to be used at a very high rate as this segment of the population ages . 
On investing in quality health care and good health , our health care system has become a vital part of our national fabric , providing the security that represents both a social and an economic benefit . 
With respect to the comments that the hon. member has made , we said before and continue to say that certainly the retirement income system of this country is an issue which we are very committed to improving . 
If this is an example of how the government spends its money , we have reason to believe that the government is going to blow it out the door once again . 
We will expand the aboriginal head start program . 
We have not heard a whole lot about that . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
We know it is imperative that all schools and Canadian school children be on line by the year 2000 . 
* * * 
Brian Mulroney damaged the national unity effort by his arrogance . 
I do not accept the claim that Newfoundland will be left behind by this government which has been standing very well for all regions of the country . 
Mr. Daniel Turp : 
ENDANGERED SPECIES 
STONY RESERVE 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
It is not difficult to see why they would favour cuts in personal income taxes when we look at an article that was printed in the Vancouver Sun on September 18 and sent to me by a constituent . 
I unfortunately do not know which constituency he represents . 
I hope that he would modify his approach somewhat over the next few months . 
I would also like to correct the hon. member on her position which seems to say the Liberals have somehow done a good thing with health care . 
Spending on Indian and northern affairs is now more than $ 6 billion a year which , as someone worked out , is the equivalent to $ 32,000 per annum for every man , woman and child in the aboriginal community . 
He talked about the fact that the Liberals have not been able to do much about unemployment . 
We have been debating the Reform motion which refers to the returning to the last 27 years of our history . 
I am working with some of my community colleges to ensure they can access these funds to build their programs . 
She asked where he was headed. 
As many of us maintained , the port was not utilized to its fullest for years . 
No. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal 
Canada Pension Plan 
Mr. Inky Mark ( Dauphin - Swan River , Ref. ) : 
Today it appears the attackers may have been Israeli Mossad agents . 
Mr. Speaker , I am not aware of the allegations that the member has made , but the role of solicitor general is not to interfere with the operation of the RCMP . 
Hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Legislation to implement the 1995 straddling convention died on the order paper when the House was dissolved for the election . 
We all know how close she is to her family and her husband . 
That the report of the Security Establishment Commissioner for the fiscal year ended March 31 , 1997 , laid upon the table April 24 , 1997 , be permanently referred to the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs . 
Agreed. 
As I have indicated on several occasions , the Government of Canada supports the proposed amendment because it is a good thing for the citizens affected by it and because it enjoys a reasonable degree of support from those citizens . 
The official opposition also wishes to propose that members and senators analysing the Quebec resolution subject it to three great tests . 
Because of a lack of democracy ? 
There is a constitution , which we did not sign for all sorts of reason , but the first - and I would propose to the Leader of the Opposition that I give him for Christmas a book written by an intellectual by the name of Mandel of the University of Toronto , who proves the point clearly . 
Madam Speaker , I appreciate the member ' s remarks . 
I will read one letter as an example . 
It is no secret to members of this Chamber that I came here almost 10 years ago from downtown Toronto because my constituents wanted somebody to make sure they had a voice that would always speak up for a strong national government . 
It has yet to be determined whether this is the right amending formula to be used in this case . 
It is still evolving . 
I am sorry but the hon. member ' s time has expired. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras 
Hon. Andy Scott 
Mr. Speaker , yes . 
Once again , we are sort of enlarging on the whole question . 
Some hon. members : 
We do have spending limits . 
I would be curious to know what my hon. friend says to new Canadians who are applying to have relatives , friends and extended families come to Canada and have to pay these exorbitant head taxes now as a result of the taxes imposed by his government on new Canadians . 
First , I wish to congratulate you on your appointment as assistant deputy chairman of committees of the whole House , and I also want to take a few moments to thank the voters of Louis - H é bert for putting their trust in me , and also the numerous volunteers without whose support I would not be here today . 
We must ensure that conditions are such that they can find their place in the sun . 
Is that what we are all about ? 
To say we have been patient is an understatement . 
Unfortunately my riding , like many other ridings and communities in Canada , is also living the consequences of federal Liberal policies of continuing high unemployment especially among youth and aboriginal peoples , of growing poverty , homelessness and inadequate housing . 
From our friends in the Reform Party there was never a question , never a concern , never an expression of interest in what was happening with the unemployed , the homeless or the sick . 
Those who have read the throne speech will know that it builds on the tremendous accomplishments of the last Parliament . 
The strange thing about history is that the more things change , the more they stay the same . 
Other than that I thought the leader of the Reform Party made an excellent speech yesterday . 
As a result , Canadians can be the masters of their own destiny . 
Mr. Bernard Bigras ( Rosemont , BQ ) : 
Canada ' s Minister of Foreign Affairs even threatened diplomatic retaliation . 
Hon. David Kilgour ( Secretary of State ( Latin America and Africa ) , Lib . ) : 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Will the minister request VIA Rail to cancel any further cuts and layoffs to VIA maintenance until the final report of the investigation is completed ? 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment as Acting Speaker of the House of Commons . 
These characteristics were essential to the settlement , development and enrichment of this great country . 
As the member just pointed out , the former debate was on what would be a fair transfer from people who have more resources to people who have fewer resources . 
The pursuit of equity and equality enables Canadians to strike a balance in our twofold commitment to promote independence and responsibility to one another . 
The cost of exclusion is far greater than the amounts we have committed to these programs . 
Unfortunately , that is the sad reality . 
We in the Bloc Quebecois are going to fight to put a stop to this sinister plan by the Liberal government . 
The fiduciary responsibility that we have as the crown with aboriginal people must be reflective of responsibility and sharing . 
There are a couple of points we should not forget . 
Indeed my own family moved west around the turn of the century to plough its section of land . 
The road was rough and winding . 
In the last decade our various political institutions have come under considerable attack , often very subtly , by those who have much to gain if the political institutions of the land can be undermined. 
I hope not because I have the greatest respect for the time limits put on me . 
Hon. Herb Gray 
Mr. Bill Blaikie 
We shall also establish a network of centres of excellence for children to encourage and to bring together research about children ' s needs so that we might know better how to help . 
Government endorsement of the joint panel ' s recommendations was equally important . 
I am sure members know how hard , in Canada ' s multiparty system , it is to get a majority win . 
The CIBC , the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and an expected 50,000 participants in 18 cities across this country are hoping to raise $ 3 million for breast cancer research , education , diagnosis and treatment . 
It is important to let the investigation proceed in the normal and effective fashion the RCMP will be undertaking . 
Mr. Speaker , the member can be assured that when the government puts together its policy toward the creation of a pharmacare plan we will do what is in the best interests of Canadians . 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
If I am wrong , I will correct myself . 
Mr. Speaker , I have personal knowledge of the awful tragedy to which the hon. member refers . 
I thank them in particular for the confidence they have shown in my generation and in the future of Quebec , a Quebec which we wish to be modern and sovereign , a Quebec that reflects my generation , open to the world and master of its destiny . 
With the exception of this small overture , what can be seen clearly in this speech is the federal government ' s stubborn determination not to recognize the legitimate right of Quebec to decide its own future . 
I believe we set out in the Speech from the Throne the way to do it . 
There are centres for excellence to advance our understanding of the needs of children , the millennium scholarship endowment fund to help students secure a post - secondary education , an extension of the internship program to give youth needed work experience , enhanced funding for student summer placement , and a Canada - wide mentorship program . 
Since my election , dozens of civilian workers have approached me and asked that I fight for their rights for a decent salary , for job security in the face of privatization . 
This past June was cause for national mourning when Stanley Knowles passed away . 
Ms. Judi Longfield ( Whitby - Ajax , Lib . ) : 
Our government ' s continued commitment to young Canadians , to innovation , to trade and rural development are the cornerstones to ensure a strong and prosperous future for the riding of Perth - Middlesex . 
Canadians must know that they can count on their health care system . 
All I read was , and I quote " Canada ' s rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim . 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano 
Hon. Jane Stewart 
Mr. Werner Schmidt 
This passive approach will be re - evaluated at the next Canada pension plan review scheduled to begin in 1999 . 
They no longer want to see government reacting . 
The parliamentary secretary is trying to make a silk purse out of a sow ' s ear if he thinks these things illustrate some profound level of accountability . 
I would also point out that the plan itself seems to be having trouble changing over to more efficient computer systems : $ 350 billion has already been spent on this and there is still a problem . 
That is basically the philosophy behind the plan . 
It is absolutely outrageous that he should be fighting for high and middle income Canadians when we have people living in poverty . 
It boils down to something quite simple and very straightforward . 
As the demographics of the country change it is important for us to accept that we are asking a smaller group of Canadians to carry a heavier burden than ever before with respect to retirement policies . 
They have been represented since 1988 by Beryl Gaffney as the member of Parliament for Nepean . 
The truth of the matter is that this government refuses to accept that taxes kill jobs . 
Ms. Louise Hardy ( Yukon , NDP ) : 
How can the minister , who just signed a joint agreement with Israel , be so sure of himself and dismiss out of hand the allegations of collusion between the two governments made by Mr. Spector ? 
The information in these files is obviously not confidential from a commercial point of view . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not agree with the preamble to the question . 
ENVIRONMENT 
Mr. Dale Johnston ( Wetaskiwin , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would think that government members would have enough interest in the Canada pension plan and the future of our security that they would at least be in the House to participate in this debate . 
The conclusions of the people of Durham are very much part of this legislation . 
I noticed that there is definitely a requirement of external auditors so that the external people will basically review the operations of that and report directly not only to government but to the people generally . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank my hon. friend for the question . 
If we are to be providing a fund perhaps as high as $ 126 billion in six years , that fund generated by the citizens of Canada ought to go into helping those firms that will create jobs . 
My concern is with the Canadian pension plan super mutual fund that the government will put in place to manage those moneys . 
There are going to be more seniors . 
There was an opportunity in 1986 to begin these changes which would have meant less dramatic changes had it been done then . 
We cannot continue to operate as though we are living in an economic and demographic situation that existed some 30 years ago when the plan was first introduced. 
This means in part making sure that Canadians forces have the right equipment for the job . 
Instead of thinking about how life would be for Canadians stuck in this situation , the government was only hoping that no one would ask the difficult questions that would embarrass it . 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Hon. Paul Martin 
Mr. John Reynolds 
Government Orders 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
We in this caucus believe that it is time to end the uncertainty which has surrounded the Canadian Wheat Board . 
Then a vote on the inclusion by the producers of that grain would also have to be held . 
This would mean that the Canadian Wheat Board would still be able to purchase the grain from producers and at the same time operate a pool . 
A performance evaluation conducted during the 1995 - 96 crop year showed Canada ranks highly with its customers in such areas as quality of product , customer service , technical support and dependability of supply . 
In Stornoway . 
We do not understand it nor do we understand the purpose of it . 
Is that not what democracy is all about ? 
That is what is happening to wheat board grains . 
I would like hon. members opposite to point out when they go about their constituency consultations that they do not want farmers who sit on this board of directors to have any protections whatsoever , to have any sort of umbrella within the Canadian Wheat Board . 
They cannot be sued for statements they make in the House . 
There is not unanimous consent . 
These minor alterations will set that balance straight and maintain an appropriate balance so all seniors will be allowed to receive CPP . 
There were very few representatives of the younger generation of Canadians welcomed at those panels . 
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Eglinton - Lawrence , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
They must go to the administrative responsibility of the person involved. 
Does the minister realize that his haphazard approach greatly penalizes the companies and workers who make the contributions , and the unemployed , who are truly unemployed , not just sort of unemployed ? 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
It reflects no policy position whatsoever of the government . 
It is taking months , at least three and a half months in my case for one bill which is still not finished. 
That is why I encourage hon. members to vote against Bill C - 2 and to support a private mandatory retirement savings vehicle , a defined contribution plan which would give more retirement security at lower cost to my generation as well as to all Canadians . 
Many people who had planned their retirement based on an existing plan will face a situation different than the one they expected , simply because the government has decided , with this bill , to protect those aged 59 and over . 
The Liberals also promised the CPP would never climb above 5 % contributions , but lo and behold they are talking about 9.9 % as though it was nothing . 
We intend to provide annual statements to all contributors as soon as it is feasible . 
The pension system is one of the very important three pillars that make up the social safety net . 
This bill addresses the concerns raised in our national hearings and again we thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance for their visionary leadership on the issue . 
The rapid aging of our population is one of the main reasons . 
Some things just do not change . 
The second alternative was that we decrease the benefits under the Canada pension plan . 
It is jointly managed by federal and provincial governments . 
The government has set up a plan that is going to set young people against their parents . 
As a teacher , I am well aware that a hungry child does not do well in school , has behaviourial problems and can become a dropout . 
Mr. Ted McWhinney 
Hon. David M. Collenette 
They are saying the institution is out of control and ready to blow . 
Mr. David Iftody ( Provencher , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
I would like to know from this minister whether , in awarding contracts , project by project , file by file , his procedure is as his colleague at human resources development has indicated , to transmit the lists to the President of Treasury Board , to the minister responsible for the Quebec region ? 
It was a remarkable show of Canadian solidarity . 
This he did. 
That may or may not be possible but the government House leader has an obligation to ask the question to the other House leaders and permit consultation . 
The petition was initiated to confront the problem with snowmobile safety , the cause of many winter deaths . 
It made me think that this is the last refuge for the vaguely talented on the opposite side . 
Mr. Dan McTeague ( Pickering - Ajax - Uxbridge , Lib . ) : 
Tenacity and perseverance will be needed. 
We were elected to this House to debate legislation . 
How will young Canadians move forward with a government that continues to hold them back ? 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment ? 
Introduction and first reading 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
The Speaker 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
When one of them loses their life in the line of duty , we all mourn that loss . 
The fact is we are not sure any more , since these allegations were made . 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
Anyhow , I still intend to restrict my comments to the debate and to the motion before us , at least as much as I can . 
How can this government not have its hands tied by all this generosity on the part of corporate Canada ? 
Earlier in her comments , the member indicated that she would not mention the Prime Minister ' s name and she did. 
We want political party financing to be changed so that it is transparent and open ; so that constituency patronage and regional patronage end ; and so that tollgating and other such issues end . 
I wonder what he will bring to the Reform Party in terms of integrity , in terms of fundraising , in terms of cleaning up the system which exists now , which quite frankly is not in tune with contemporary politics and contemporary thinking in society . 
However before we go off the deep end and make all kinds of assumptions , particularly that the government has wronged and wronged , why do we not just wait for the investigation ? 
I ask the member for T é miscamingue to tell us if , in his region , only one mine or only one industry was approached. 
It is a serious offence . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
On April 19 , 1995 - 
I simply cannot , as two of Canada ' s major political parties have proved the contrary . 
Mr. Speaker , on October 9 , 1867 , three months after the proclamation of Canadian Confederation , 167 physicians from the then four provinces of Canada met in Quebec City to establish the Canadian Medical Association . 
YOUTH EMPLOYMENT 
At the time , the Prime Minister was quick to criticize another government . 
The fact that the Bloc insists on mentioning names - 
Pan - Canadian generated a four fold improvement between 1995 and 1996 . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Health . 
I invite hon. members , especially him , to pay attention because in the last parliament and in all parliaments we have had Senate public bills debated in the House . 
The objectives of the legislation were to limit to voters - and this is true democracy - the right to contribute to political parties , because we speak on their behalf and we should not be influenced by companies roping us in with lavish contributions . 
Bloc members say Quebec must serve its citizens . 
Whenever there was the slightest hint of wrongdoing by the Tory government , Liberal members were on their feet complaining bitterly about the lack of integrity in Tory party fundraising exercises . 
It would have taken about 4,000 contributors of the Reform Party simply to pay for the Leader of the Opposition ' s suits . 
The Department of Human Resources Development tried to find premises for the Canada Employment Centre in Saint - J é r ô me because the lease expired on May 31 , 1998 . The Department of Public Works called for tenders . 
I understands why he left . 
Last October 1 , following up on a question asked in the House , the Solicitor General of Canada , the minister responsible for the RCMP , stated that he was not aware of an RCMP investigation concerning the fundraising practices in Quebec of the Liberal party of Canada . 
Those who know something about his political career will recall that he is the one who nationalized power companies in Quebec , and he has been put under intense pressure at that time . 
The fourth is access to broadcasting to ensure that all parties ' messages are heard . 
Next year or the year after it might be something that the member has not anticipated. 
An hon. member : 
I wonder if it was just a slight memory lapse or if there was another reason that it missed all these huge donations . 
I would call this a win situation . 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Health Care 
Agent status will allow ports to pay for grants in lieu of taxes and will reinforce the ports ' immunity from provincial taxation and regulation . 
Of course , we are happy to see that the government has also accepted the Bloc Quebecois ' recommendation that compulsory pilotage be maintained in Canada . 
The Saint John Ports Canada Police service will be disbanded as will be the case for all other port detachments if this bill passes . 
UKRAINIAN CANADIANS 
The hon. member for Churchill River . 
Was it because they gave a $ 1,500 donation to the Prime Minister ' s election fund ? 
Can the minister come clean and tell us by whom and how Mr. Corbeil was informed that applications awaiting approval by the government were sitting on his desk ? 
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Jean J . Charest : 
I move : 
Mr. Bob Kilger ( Stormont - Dundas , Lib . ) : 
It also concerns me because , as the member for Beauport - Montmorency - Orl é ans pointed out , all the Great Lakes traffic passes by us . 
Another concern that we have in Atlantic Canada is the concern of labour with regard to this legislation . 
I will take a different slant on this issue . 
To conclude , let me add that we would like to vote in favour of the bill as a whole at third reading . 
BUS ACCIDENT 
JUSTICE 
The rate is often reduced to 10 % where interest payments go abroad . 
In fact anyone in the United States who earns up to the equivalent amount of $ 40,800 Canadian as a senior would pay no taxes on their social security benefits , none , zero , zip . 
That is a good question members opposite will have to answer . 
In the main we support the direction in which the bill is going . 
To prevent tax evasion the treaties provide for the exchange of information . 
Most people can see what the real issue is today . 
My constituents have sent me to Ottawa to hold this Liberal government responsible and accountable for job creation , tax relief , making our streets safe again , repairing the social safety net and securing our national unity as well as to hold this government ' s feet to the fire for every misspent hard earned Canadian taxpayer dollar . 
Cambodia was having a difficult time reducing its public service because it did not even know how large it was . 
Under this change , all low income Canadians that the Reform MPs have been talking about today will pay no tax . 
The Minister of Finance can show us those numbers . 
Mr. Speaker , prior to my election to the House of Commons in 1993 , I spent 25 years as a member of the Canadian auto workers union . 
Stornoway will never be the same . 
It is not peanuts . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
SECURITY IN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS 
Everyone can help to appreciate it . 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
This is tax evasion . 
Bill C - 10 corrects that . 
Provinces are for their own and different reasons taking measures to rationalize the health care system and its delivery in their provinces . 
I appreciate this exchange for no other reason than now some members opposite are asking themselves what is the difference between an investment and a tax . 
Regarding where the money would come from , it would come from a fair taxation policy for the hundreds of corporations and wealthy individuals who pay no tax to this country for those programs now . 
I congratulate them on that . 
Trade and investment between Canada and Kazakhstan are expected to increase upon the conclusion of the convention which will enter into force on the date of the exchange of the instruments of ratification . 
It actually affects about 100,000 people when we take into account those across the border and all the intricacies of the plan . 
Other governments in the past have had a certain practice of bringing through their most draconian tax increasing legislation right after an election in the hopes that taxpayers will forget the wrongs done them . 
We are debating at this time the issue of the government pulling parliamentary procedures out of a hat so that it can get legislation through the House quickly and Canadians do not realize what is actually happening . 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
The government seems to continually do procedural things to prevent seniors from having that understanding , so that they can accept change and understand why the changes are taking place . 
That is wrong . 
Honourable ladies and gentlemen . 
We do not even have an opportunity to phone our constituents to find out what they are saying , far less distribute the contents or the principle of this bill and find out what our constituents think . 
Let us call it what it is , an elected dictatorship between elections . 
I have been here only a few weeks . 
Allotted Day - Unemployment 
Miss Deborah Grey 
Allotted day - Funding of political parties 
The Deputy Speaker : 
The hon. member for Halifax for a brief reply . 
I know the member in a previous incarnation was very proud of some of those programs in terms of the ideas he promoted in the province of Manitoba , and I hope he still is . 
Mr. Speaker , we have heard an eloquent plea on behalf of our health care system which is dear to every Canadian . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his question . 
The young person you were speaking about will have made contributions but will never be entitled to them . 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time today with the member for Churchill . 
Over the last two years 700 individuals in the health care system have lost their jobs due to the cuts by the government . 
That is the economic plan at work . 
We need to ensure they will have the best opportunities available . 
The government members of the day made promises on the stumps back in 1966 . 
Canada ' s banks have made profits in the billions of dollars and they are letting people go , not creating jobs . 
They said that of course they would reduce the debt first because if that is done first , everything will follow . 
The deficit stands at $ 8.9 billion with an expectation that the budget of the Government of Canada will be fully balanced with a deficit of zero by the next fiscal year . 
I tell him I am at Indian Head , a few kilometres away , and I am doing great .

Why does he do it ?

Mr. John Reynolds ( West Vancouver - Sunshine Coast , Ref. ) : 
The auditor general says that if progress continues at the current rate , a failure of critical systems could affect public health , safety and essential services . 
Over the last couple of years the independent legal services available to me through legislative counsel have been constantly eroded by administrative decree . 
These are the minister ' s own figures . 
I know that the member has a lot of criticisms on the Minister of Finance ' s position on the economy . 
They are in danger of being left behind in today ' s economy . 
Every six months , every month , a notice goes out asking them to pay back their loan with interest . 
We have worked all our lives . 
Under the Liberal plan what is happening ? 
Allow me to quote at some length from one provincial NDP premier . 
If I ask my constituents how the debt was created they would not say high interest rates , they would not say say by lost tax revenues , they would say by overspending . 
I will make every effort to represent them to the best of my ability . 
This government is not prepared to do anything about the radical imbalance of the unemployment figures as they affect youth in this country . 
For Quebec , the equalization payment was $ 216 of the Canada transfer and for the others it was $ 1.381 billion . 
It is saying that increased spending does not necessarily get results .

Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the House will be well aware that the government is already committed to establishing a $ 12.5 billion floor for the cash transfer to the provinces beginning next year . 
The clock is ticking for sports and cultural events , and I would therefore ask the Minister of Health the following question : 
Mr. Bill Casey ( Cumberland - Colchester , PC ) : 
The Speaker : 
With respect to the Board of Internal Economy , I do not think it is their responsibility . 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
These essential features will be strengthened and enshrined by reinforcing the requirement that a co - operative must be organized and operated on a co - operative basis . 
I cannot conceive of that much money but let us put it into perspective so that Canadians can understand . 
Because of the changes affecting markets , because of globalization and the stiff competition often faced by co - ops , particularly those that are key players . 
We rely on her sage wisdom . 
Madam Speaker , I listened with some interest to the member opposite with respect to what he was saying and , of course , in typical Reform fashion , preaching the politics of fear and the politics of doom and gloom . 
By the turn of the century there were thousands of co - operatives throughout Europe and a growing co - op movement in Canada . 
I talked to the participants of the project which I visited that day . 
The legislation allows a number of things . 
It does not generally allow proxy voting . 
If it has expired she takes full responsibility . 
The report of the auditor general shows that in one three - month period 15,000 aboriginal people went to three or more pharmacies , 1,600 obtained more than 15 drugs and over 700 people had 50 prescriptions or more . 
Mr. Paul Szabo 
Hon. David Anderson 
Mr. Randy White 
Mr. Speaker , I would request that you rule on my request for unanimous consent now , so that I can carry on with my remarks since I was in the middle of making them . 
ALLOTTED DAY - CANADIAN FISHING INDUSTRY 
It included " career planning and employment counselling " and " sustainable development in Canada ' s long term economic development '' . 
Some money should be put toward that end . 
I am sure that the hon. member from P.E.I. wants them to have their dignity as well . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
We are faced with an example very much like what happened in the 1980 s , which led to a ghastly deficit. 
I can hardly stand in this House of Commons and honestly believe that the government would go to fishers in Atlantic Canada and say " would you like your income support dropped off by a year ? " 
What we are trying to deal with in Atlantic Canada is not just for TAGS recipients but for the entire economy of Atlantic Canada . 
I guess today we are asking the government to recognize that there are things that have been done wrong over the years which are really impacting upon our people today . 
We are talking about a national policy for a sustainable fisheries . 
Month after month , year after year , Mr. Crosbie had to put up with the pressure of bad decisions being made that led to the collapse of the fishery . 
We are reducing the number of fishermen . 
My second point to the minister is that when he talks about making fisheries somewhat more self - reliant , he is in fact talking about co - management . 
On the east coast we had a collapse of the cod fishery which essentially occurred as a result of the actions of the previous Tory administration and the fallout from this collapse has been exacerbated by the Liberals . 
That is what I would promote . 
Mr. Speaker , I certainly want to try to reply to the hon. member . 
We thank them and applaud them . 
During this small business week Canadian entrepreneurs can celebrate the contribution they make to the Canadian economy and to all Canadians . 
I repeat my question : 
How can he base his position on an agreement that does not exist , that is , the one between Canada and France , thus denying women and children in Quebec their child support ? 
PENITENTIARIES 
There is not one area of the country that will not be negatively affected by the results of climate change . 
Fred leaves behind a wonderful family : his wife Frances , his one sister Deanne , two sons , Fred and David , two daughters , Susan and Patricia , two step - children , Susan and Richard , and 10 grandchildren . 
Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
Certainly it is an issue that spans the entire country and touches on the Arctic Ocean as well . 
That is one approach . 
I would like to tell the House right now that I will be dividing my time with my colleague , the hon. member for Gander - Grand Falls . 
In 1991 five foreign nations were given so - called developmental quotas to catch mackerel as they entered Sydney Bight . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has been engaged in soft peddling this issue . 
There were some problems but we were there when we were needed and we will continue to be there when we are needed in the future . 
Risk factors on which we can have some kind of influence are hypercholesterolemia , high blood pressure , smoking and an inactive lifestyle . 
Our system of national health insurance , or medicare , as it is popularly known , is close to the hearts of Canadians and something too precious to tamper with for no valid reason . 
The greatest concern for the public - and the auditor general echoed this concern after realizing in his analysis that this was not being done - is to determine how the reserve fund amount is set . 
Mr. John Maloney 
Mr. Bill Matthews 
For all these reasons , the February 1994 budget announced a thorough review of the Canadian tariff system over a three - year period . 
Then there was all the discussion around whether or not it applied to the legislation that was in place . 
Customs duties are bound to be reduced or to remain at their current level . 
From my perspective , pornography is essentially degrading to women and I am at a loss to comprehend how any feminist writer could perceive it otherwise . 
What has gone wrong with the Reform Party ? 
In response to a serious question the Minister of National Defence gave partisan lines that were inappropriate . 
Would the minister agree , in light of the importance of this issue to meet with the agencies concerned and to hold public hearings on the subject ? 
Mr. Speaker , on the particulars of the case the member is asking about I can give him this commitment . 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand . 
It does not produce or export bananas . 
Just a few weeks ago the government was reprimanded for the untimeliness of the year 2000 project . 
For example , the world ' s largest gypsum mine borders on my riding . 
Sorry . 
In the early 1990 s , 60 % of people contributed to the employment insurance fund and eventually became eligible for benefits . 
We will continue to monitor the impact of the new system on seasonal workers so appropriate adjustments can be made , but it is far too early to start tinkering with the program . 
No. 
I was unemployed until June 2 , 1997 . 
Miss Deborah Grey 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott 
The response was anything but clear . 
If Reform were looking at this ferry service and how it could be best run , the first thing we would look at is what would best serve the interests of the people who are being affected by the service , who are using the service , who are the end users of whatever government does here . 
On an issue as important as schools , it is doubly important to hear a wide range of opinions at the federal level . 
If no such convincing evidence is presented to us and our constituents and we remain doubtful then our inclination would be to vote against it . 
Why is it that the democratic will of the people of Newfoundland can be recognized in this instance , but not the democratic will of Quebeckers in other instances ? 
They have all these guys appointed for life and they never have to face the electorate '' . 
There is a basic contradiction here . 
The Pentecostal and Catholic organizations got together and mobilized their forces and came within a few percentage points of defeating the original motion . 
I will be voting for this measure . 
TRANS - CANADA HIGHWAY 
Why does she start at the top , say she is going to sign something and then come back and persuade the Canadian players to get an agreement ? 
That will determine when and where we then present those reports to the President of the United States and the Prime Minister . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Durham has been a fervent advocate of changes to the Canada - U.S. treaty , as indeed have a number of other members in the House , changes which would bring needed relief to tens of thousands of low and middle income Canadians . 
If so , does a strategy to implement the - 
When I looked at that and at the population of Newfoundland with 37 denominational school boards it seemed like an onerous system . 
( 2 ) In and for the province of Newfoundland , the legislature shall exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education , but shall provided for courses in religion that are not specific to a religious denomination . 
This kind of argument does not hold water , given the rights enjoyed by the anglophones in Quebec . 
It only works one way . 
It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Mississauga West , Airports ; the hon. member for Frontenac - M é gantic , Closure of a B.C. Mine ; the hon. member for Davenport , Law of the Sea . 
I took my two sons out of the regular school system in Saint John , New Brunswick . 
The Reform Party believes strongly that education is a matter of provincial responsibility and that provincial jurisdiction over education should be respected and enhanced. 
Members of the House of Commons did not travel . 
Government refused to allow scrutineers at polling stations , denying advocates an opportunity to observe the voting process to ensure that it was fair and democratic . 
Members may be aware that this question was developed by the Newfoundland government ' s public relations firm and was one of several potential questions subjected to some mini polling and focus groups to try to massage it to the point where it came up with a question that would ensure a certain outcome of the vote . 
We would also like to see a free vote on this . 
Only three times , Mr. Speaker . 
You have to admit , as I do , that these three measures are definitely not enough to help our workers . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy 
FAIR WAGES AND HOURS OF LABOUR ACT 
In fact , since the bill was presented during the 35 th Parliament , further consultations have been held with the First Nations concerned. 
So all responsibilities with respect to exploration will also be transferred to the Government of the Yukon Territory . 
It is important for me to refer to the document , because not only is it rather complex , but also the names themselves are often complicated. 
Federal devolution is part of a parallel process within the Yukon government . 
He mentioned a concern I share , and perhaps we can come up with some solution in discussing it on the floor of the House . 
We must deal with entire ecosystems and adapt to a new way of managing environmental regions . 
So I am pleased to speak today to Bill C - 6 dealing with the establishment of certain boards to provide for an integrated system of land and water management in the Mackenzie Valley , and with consequential amendments to other Acts . 
I have just told you that it was . 
They want to review the original treaties and interpret them . 
Essentially there were and remain , of course , concerns about a disruption of a way of life , a disruption of the lands and the waters . 
The parliamentary secretary has informed the House that the regional land claim agreements of the Gwich ' in , the Sahtu Dene and Metis commit the government to establish a new resource regulatory regime in the respective settlement areas . 
I ask the hon. member if she would please tell the House to what degree would her government be prepared to amend the proposed bill which is now before the House to accommodate some of the questions and concerns that the first nations , the Metis and business people have , as well as other people across Canada . 
When I read people are afraid we are creating policy that will wind up in court , I have grave concerns about where we are going . 
The plan must be approved by the affected aboriginal group and the federal and territorial governments . 
My riding of Brampton West - Mississauga is home to one of Canada ' s largest confectionery manufacturers , Hershey , which employs 1,600 people across Canada .

Different values and visions create different management styles that could led to conflict and confrontation . 
We know it is out there but how people actually do it is something we can benefit from . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
We might have one . 
I reject that 100 % completely and totally . 
They were willing to recognize the power of the country and the resources that need to be developed for the betterment of all but in co - operation and with respect for each other . 
It is impossible . 
Is not the whole purpose of this to properly manage the land and water resources of a very valuable region , to manage them for the benefit of the people there ? 
The people and the Government of the Northwest Territories agree . 
No. 
( d ) by inserting after the word " Committee " in the sixth paragraph the words : " be directed and authorized to hold hearings in Newfoundland and '' ; 
Almost exactly a year ago , on October 30 , 1996 , the House passed Bill C - 35 , which aligned the federal minimum wage with the general minimum wage rates established by the provinces and territories . 
It also aims at removing the wage element from the tender process so that public funds are not used to exploit workers . 
Madam Speaker , certainly the issue I am speaking to is something I am quite excited about .

Never have so many given so much for such obvious rewards . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
One of the members from Ottawa raised them , as well as a number of provincial governments . 
The solicitor general is telling us that he is prepared to accept the situation the director of the Laval - des - Rapides penitentiary put himself in . 
Shortly after I took office I indicated my support for Mr. Fortier ' s work and I still have full confidence in him . 
Some hon. members : 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
These changes have been made with the support of all the parties involved. 
Question . 
Let me illustrate . 
It includes everything north of 60 , south of the Inuvialuit claims area , east of the Yukon border and west of the Nunavut settlement area . 
( Motion agreed to ) 
My answer to that is if you are going to make a mistake , if you are going to err , it is far better to err on the side of victims than on the side of accused criminals . 
As I have indicated I look forward to the debate . 
Call in the members . 
The member for Saint John has been a tireless supporter of the shipbuilding industry since she has become a member of Parliament and during 20 years in municipal politics as well . 
There is nothing new here . 
While other countries continue to make the necessary investment in upgrading their shipbuilding yards and technology , with some exceptions Canada has continued to rely on outdated capital equipment . 
It is increasingly apparent that this government is beholden absolutely to the big corporations , the bankers , the stockbrokers and the bondholders in the global community today , that it is no longer able to distinguish between the public interest and the commercial interest . 
MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT RETIRING ALLOWANCES ACT 
Hon. Sergio Marchi 
Mr. Philip Mayfield 
People will continue to drive and be convicted of impaired driving . 
The rationale behind the horse racing community is that we have to be careful and have a great concern for the equine flesh . 
I agree with assertions of the hon. member about this . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his presentation today and for indicating that he will support this motion . 
Add to that the pain and suffering one feels when the car accident is unnecessary because someone has chosen to drink and drive . 
He quoted some statistics . 
Although my father was not exactly sure of what he was doing at the time because of the state he was in , it was criminal behaviour . 
We can look at all kinds of alternative sentencing , but do not let them get to that point. 
There was an element of his speech that I would like to draw to the attention of the House , the statement that Canadians find it unacceptable to drink and drive . 
This happens in my constituency and I know it happens in other constituencies . 
I was very honoured to have seconded it . 
I recently said to someone that we do not have to say that an issue is controversial. 
As I lay there on the pavement , Mom , I hear the policeman say , 
He served a very short time in jail . 
It is very sad we only realize the hurt of the tragedy after the fact . 
Mr. Speaker , last week , Fonorola from Montreal invested $ 100 million in optical fibre equipment to proceed with its 12,000 kilometre telecommunications network project . 
Why does he not just rule out tax increases right now ? Rule them out . 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
Mr. Speaker , there is a court injunction . 
He has a choice to be the minister of tobacco or the Minister of Health . 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
It is perhaps one of the greatest social issues which extends across boundaries from coast to coast . 
The deaths , the broken homes and the social cost of irresponsible drinking especially is just not something I want to participate in . 
There is a problem with increasing penalties for drunk driving . 
The committee that will be struck can cast some light on this and report to the House . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur : 
Mr. Speaker , the member for Ottawa West - Nepean raised some personal experiences and I think we all have them . 
Mr. Paul Szabo : 
Abraham Lincoln said that alcohol has many defenders , but nobody has ever come up with a defence . 
Most TAGS money has been used directly by people to keep bread on the table . 
We are talking about medical personnel , lab technicians and support personnel , exactly the sort of people that Newfoundland needs in a high tech world . 
Even Department of Finance studies indicate that high payroll taxes cut and restrict the number of jobs . 
The rich get richer , but the ordinary folks continue to suffer . 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the question of the hon. member for Waterloo - Wellington . 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew 
Bill C - 217 . 
That decision of the five Canadians sitting in the Supreme Court of Canada , according to the legal opinions we have heard , will allow the man to walk free . 
If it is open ended we are going to be back over and over again to deal with this kind of situation where the Supreme Court of Canada decides . 
It is the case with regard to battering a door down . 
I invite all members and those watching these proceedings to make Sault Ste. Marie and the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre a must stop on their next trip to northern Ontario . 
Is the position of the Reform Party nothing more than what was done by the tongue troopers in the Reform leader ' s office when they muzzled the Reform critic and said that anything he says is nothing more than a dopey mental hiccup ? 
I said to the member there is no Canadian and no political party in this House that wants a lower degradation for our environment or lower standards of workers rights . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
We are looking to the future in terms of continuing to utilize hatcheries and keep them operating through those kinds of partnership agreements . 
As a result , the government then in power had to raise premiums by 30 % at the height of the recession , thus creating more unemployment . 
Those who were watching and those who will read the proceedings will not be left in any doubt exactly what the government is attempting to do . 
The specific concerns I raised at the outset surrounding hot pursuit are issues which I hope will be the subject of lively discussion at the committee level . 
There is a great deal of trouble with our justice system and Canadians are telling us that . 
The police officer under the old rules would have said " Let ' s go and get him " and if he is in a dwelling house he would have made entry . 
It is in committee that we have to address these other issues . 
I will quote from the actual poll results : 
It would create an anomaly in the Access to Information Act creating an obligation for ministers to report to the House on results of public opinion polls , thereby doing away with the formal request for information scheme . 
Monday , November 3 , 1997 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
Mr. John Williams 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
With an increasingly global or international marketplace , smart businesses have workforces that are reflective of their marketplaces . 
If it goes any further than what it already has , the delay could be counted not in months or weeks but in years . 
Mr. Speaker , Bill C - 3 is a continuation of Bill C - 104 , which is now part of the Criminal Code . 
In this respect , the bill has the merit of providing a list of designated offences for which ordinary people would agree that police officers and the judicial system should be allowed to use DNA testing and to collect samples of blood , saliva or other bodily substances from an individual. 
When the previous minister introduced the first incarnation of the DNA identification act , he stated the importance of getting the data bank correct the first time . 
The Reform Party was in favour of this before the election and even offered to fast track this bill before the election because Reform members saw it having significant importance in being able to identify criminals . 
It is trying to take that identification tool one step further . 
It is very important that this bill be applied retroactively to individuals now in jail who have committed serious offences . 
They are the peacekeepers and therefore responsible for we want in our society . 
Six years with the possibility of parole in just two . 
Mr. Speaker , look out , look out , Lucien Bouchard is in China . 
The Reform Party could learn a lot by listening to Albertans . 
We ran out of time . 
Given the extremely powerful leadership role Canada has taken in this regard , I would like to know what specific measures are being taken , both for the conference itself and in terms of post - conference follow - up ? 
I specifically remember the hon. member attended the opening with much fanfare . 
Mr. Speaker , as members know , I had also sent notice to the Speaker that I wished to address a point of order , the same one of course . 
Yes , Mr. Speaker . 
Members of the RCMP , like other Canadian employees , are entitled , under a government program , to benefits in the event of disease , disability or death attributable to their employment . 
However , unfortunately , I am not so sure . 
There is something fundamentally wrong when long expected pay increases for service men and women have been put on hold for five , six and going on seven years when just last month the Treasury Board approved huge bonuses for an executive group of the public service , bonuses of $ 4,500 , even reaching $ 12,000 per individual. 
Like their Canadian forces colleagues in traditional peacekeeping settings , RCMP peacebuilders often face violent opposition to their presence . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
The first one has to do with health warning labels . 
In the establishment of the first federal - provincial marine park in salt water , we are setting a framework to keep this park forever , into infinity , not just so we can sail , if we have the means - and not everybody does - but so generations of young Canadians in the future can see what it is that drew people inexorably to this fantastic country called Canada . 
I cite by way of example a situation in my constituency . 
Along the north shore of the St. Lawrence , the co - ordination zone stretches from Saint - Fid è le - de - Mont - Murray to Les Escoumins and includes the territory of the Essipit aboriginal community . 
The protection of the proposed park will require an effective management plan and I agree with the concerns raised by my colleagues on behalf of concerned Canadians and international organizations . 
A park could not be developed without consultations because it is another very important aspect of our economy . 
First , successful co - operation among all stakeholders , starting with a Conservative federal government and a Liberal government in Quebec , followed by a Liberal federal government and a PQ government in Quebec . 
We have held extensive consultations with Canadians to move forward with comprehensive legislation within which other marine conservation areas can be established. 
That being said , there is some concern about the way in which this bill came before Parliament . 
So this master plan could be changed at any time in order to increase or reduce the protection of marine resources , in spite of all the good will expressed here today . 
An integrated approach would allow all countries and regions to enjoy the benefits of electronic commerce while avoiding duplication of effort and the creation of new international trade barriers . 
Third , developing countries such as China , India and Mexico that will be the big contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the future are not part of the Kyoto agreement . 
Would that get its attention ? 
* * * 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
The hon. member should know that here , in Canada , we have the lowest telecommunications rates in the world , for both local and long distance calls . 
TRADE 
It does not take us into the information age as the minister so clearly likes to tell us it does . 
So , when considering what a basic telephone service is , it is not possible to keep talking about increases strictly in the context of national and international competition . 
We are told that Canada ' s telecommunications firms will have easier access to a more competitive international market and will capture a larger share of the $ 880 billion global telecommunications industry . 
We see it as a way to prove to the rest of the world that we can be competitive , can create jobs and can do it through a free trade agreement . 
Because of a previous government ' s initiative Canada ' s main objective of having secure access to the American market is now a reality and this bill increases that access . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
I do not know with whom they spoke . 
That is absolutely tremendous and the CRTC ought to be commended for it . 
I declare the motion carried. 
Finally she had a stroke which prevented her from using her communicator and she spent the last few years of her life in total isolation wailing dreadfully , pleading for an end to her suffering . 
GPs permit about 2,000 cases of euthanasia per year . 
It is important to remember that . 
The peoples summit is a tremendous opportunity for Canadians and for people in APEC countries to raise concerns about human rights , about workers rights , about the environment , and I want to pay tribute to the organizers of the upcoming peoples summit in Vancouver later this month . 
The Department of Human Resources Development Canada has changed its focus from passive income support to active measures in order to help workers reintegrate into the workforce . 
YOUTH EMPLOYMENT 
National Highway System 
They are not willing to pay this huge price for political pandering . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , I plan to share the contents of this letter with the hon. member . 
Some hon. members : 
Meanwhile on the west coast , Americans continue to overfish and continue to violate the Pacific salmon treaty and this government does nothing . 
How can the President of the Treasury Board , himself a francophone , justify this kind of doublespeak on the part of his government , which claims to support French - speaking minorities while continuing to cut services ? 
This bill will ensure that ministers cannot hide behind the Privacy Act for political reasons . 
TAXATION 
I believe I have the consent of the House for the following motion : 
This week we had another striking example , Bill C - 14 on drinking water . 
What happens with separations ? 
I would like to know exactly what he means by " role to play , as leader " in the area of child custody , alimony , education in terms of level of studies and access . 
Surely what we should be looking at is the experience , the needs and the aspirations of Canadian parents . 
There are provisions already in place '' . 
I am also proud to say that the drinking water materials safety act will build upon the unique collaborative and co - operative working relationship Canada has enjoyed with the other jurisdictions in this country . 
They went through all the things we could do to address the crime of auto theft . 
The amendment in Bill C - 209 is not really necessary . 
At the Maple Ridge program only 6 % of the participants reoffended in the following year . 
All the delegates at the Oslo conference agreed that the countries of the world must take every step possible to suppress such atrocities as the sale and trafficking of children , forced and compulsory labour , debt bondage and child slavery , and the use of children for any type of work that is likely to jeopardize their health , their safety or their moral and social development .

BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
This dismissive view of the legislative process , repeated often enough , makes a mockery of our parliamentary conventions and practices . 
Quebeckers were stunned to see him do that . 
In a sense , what the Bloc is doing today is really business as usual , it is twisting the facts to try to discredit the federal system , a system which has no place in the separatists ' future . 
I am going to conclude simply by saying that compensation to Quebec for the GST deal which it entered into sets a horrible precedent . 
In the meanwhile , we will resume debate . 
They are nice people but why do they continue to perpetuate this cruel tax on us ? 
Why was it necessary to overpay these provinces by more than $ 570 million ? 
This is the first example of data missing from the Minister of Finance ' s assessment , or rejected out of hand by him , because he does not want anything to do with an accurate overall assessment - and , what is more , he knows he is wrong . 
We do not live in an ideal world and there are taxes to be paid. 
Full harmonization with the GST means that you have the same tax base , the same rate and that members of the HST , provinces and the national government , would move in concert if we see a rise in rates , a reduction in rates or an expansion of the tax base . 
As a result one form was eliminated by those provinces that harmonized , which provided for some reduction in the burden of compliance . 
SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE 
The minister has just accused us of partisan politics . 
They are calling for integrity in government . 
For our honourable war veterans and remembered war dead we pause to give our respect . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Speaker , last week the finance minister told the House that all provincial governments had agreed to the consultation document on gender analysis of changes to the Canada pension plan . 
Albertans are sick and tired. 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Maurice Godin ( Ch â teauguay , BQ ) : 
And now it is really hurting . 
( Motion agreed to ) 
The facts are clear . 
I am imploring the Minister of Public Works and Government Services to have the courage to break the chain and to consult his colleagues in the House before he issues a purchase order to the tune of several million dollars . 
Not bad for a member in Ottawa . 
The Liberals had promised to get rid of the GST. 
Ms. Angela Vautour : 
We could continue to pay down the deficit. 
If it had not been for that , we would have been in three or four times worse shape than we are in now . 
Don ' t drink . 
Mr. Nick Discepola : 
I have heard conflicting claims . 
If this will further the cause of justice , then it is something we have to work together in a non - partisan way to see carried through to fruition . 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
It was not a deadline that we imposed on this House . 
That Bill C - 16 , in Clause 3 , be amended by 
On the other hand , if the House wishes to give me other instructions , I am prepared to listen . 
The citizens of Havelock are an example to us all . 
The case is to be heard later this month . 
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question . 
Why has it not been done and why will it not be done now and tabled before this house ? 
* * * 
Does the hon. member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve have the unanimous consent of the House to speak to this report ? 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Some hon. members : 
I withdraw my question . 
The lessons and arguments in that instance will serve to highlight what I feel are the pitfalls where distinct society is concerned. 
As I have already stated , we all agree with the principle of equality among citizens and provinces . 
Do you remember the Meech Lake accord in 1990 ? 
Once they get the recognition , they also want to have a veto over changes to the Constitution .

CANADA POST 
People who have rental units can even include automobile expenses that they use for servicing the property , advertizing and commissions paid to obtain tenants . 
Quite frankly , the expenditure of $ 3 billion that is strictly targeted to first time home buyers or , as another hon. member mentioned , an expenditure of $ 6 billion annually across the board would result in some reallocation of services or an increase in taxes in order to maintain a balanced budget , in order to maintain the level of services Canadians expect . 
This bill is an expensive and unfair way and as a result I think will not see the light of day . 
The Constitution Act , 1867 , is amended by adding , immediately after section 93 , the following : 
I support the proposed amendment to section 93 created and passed unanimously by the Quebec National Assembly . 
For both historical and contemporary reasons , the majority of these immigrants enrol their children in English and Protestant schools . 
We must keep in mind that the RCMP used dogs , tear gas and nightsticks against children and parents . 
In fact , I do not think it is an exaggeration to say the Reform Party has a bad reputation with minority groups right across Canada . 
I was taking my information from them . 
I am glad we can show Quebeckers how the Canadian Parliament has played a productive role in this amendment . 
These people were not lawyers , education bureaucrats or politicians . 
Why carry the ball all the way down the field only to drop it ? 
Yet they allowed him to walk away without a hearing and without the determination of guilt . 
These are the words - 
Now that he knows for sure that the budget will be balanced this year , does the Minister of Finance intend to return to the provinces at least part of what he stole from them instead of taking this money - 
What action has the minister taken so far to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for war criminals ? 
Is it on the same point of order ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am probably out of sequence time wise on this , but during question period the Deputy Prime Minister referred to and read from a document . 
The consensus is large . 
It is a fear that I want to encourage them not to have . 
Some people claim that there has been little or no consultation in Quebec . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to remind the hon. member of the Reform Party that I never spoke of unanimity ; we are talking about consensus . 
The thing that is becoming interesting is the suggestion that it should be accompanied by at least partial funding from state , from public authority . 
Among other avenues , the Government of Quebec could have had its ministers involved in the process earlier rather than relying on quiet passage . 
The Reform Party is suggesting that it is the separatists who want this . 
Madam Speaker , I recognize the member would have preferred to have addressed his question to my colleague , and so I will make a suggestion in that regard in a moment . 
No person shall be denied the right of education .

HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Speaker , it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C - 11 today . 
The proposed changes in the bill include a consolidation of Canadian tariff obligations under the Canada - U.S. Free Trade Agreement , the North American Free Trade Agreement , the World Trade Organization , the Canada - Israel Free Trade Agreement and the Canada - Chile Free Trade Agreement . 
When we speak of consultations , perhaps we should use the same definition , and when we speak about bogus consultations , we could perhaps ask the Liberals to give us a definition , because they are very good at that . 
Mr. Charlie Power : 
Another question we have is the question of how these officers will be empowered to enforce the law . 
Section 495 also provides that this power can only be exercised under exceptional circumstances , that is when the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that public interest requires such an intervention . 
The night of October 3 , 1997 at the customs port of Windygates , Manitoba was a prime example of the need for customs inspectors to have the authority to detain impaired drivers . 
In conclusion , on balance I know that the people in my riding are pleased that the pressure is going to be taken off the local police . 
It is absolutely essential to us that we properly train and provide all the necessary tools and safety and security not only to the public but to people who are within our employ and who the department is responsible for . 
I am confident that the solution contained in Bill C - 18 will work and I am pleased to present it for the approval of my hon. colleagues in this Chamber . 
I have seen on television where at night in the winter there are skidoos and other vehicles crossing the St. Lawrence River and not in any way being apprehended by anybody , police officers , peace officers or customs officers or anyone else . 
The concerns being expressed today are very minimal. 
Groups such as CAVEAT , Canadians Against Violence Everywhere Advocating Its Termination , the Canadian Civil Liberties Association , police forces , Revenue Canada employees , and CEUDA have offered their support . 
Today their representatives from coast to coast are here in the House of Commons to remind parliamentarians of the importance of this industry for Canada . 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian ( Brampton Centre , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
We will not sacrifice our efforts to reduce the deficit and to bring down our debt just because this party is calling for a tax cut . 
The two parties have been in negotiations since yesterday . 
* * * 
By allowing this practice to continue , Mr. Speaker , you are discriminating against the voters of my riding and the voters of the other members who find themselves in a situation where they do not belong to a political party . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res , BQ ) : 
Customs officers will be trained to ensure that they act fairly , responsibly and within the confines of the law in carrying out their duties . 
The Bengal tigers of India were for a time increasing after some measures were invoked by India . 
The bill is purported to look at materials , piping , filtration , chlorination systems and matters that are not supposed to be under provincial control . 
In recent years , we learned that we must be very vigilant whenever this government introduces a bill because , as the Reform Party member pointed out , certain provisions often go well beyond the stated intentions . 
He quoted Quebec ' s deputy minister of health as saying : " As far as protecting public health is concerned , we therefore have no objections to this bill going forward - " 
Let me elaborate . 
We have been at this almost a year . 
NOW THEREFORE the House of Commons resolves that an amendment to the Constitution of Canada be authorized to be made by proclamation issued by His Excellency the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada in accordance with the schedule hereto . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
As members of Parliament , we should work to create laws that encourage creativity rather than control it or use it for political propaganda . 
It has no market in Canadian society . 
The tribunal decision will provide the parameters for calculating the pay equity gap but will most likely leave some issues unresolved and this will require further discussions with PSAC .

Past and present instructors at the 2310 can take pride in the fact that they have helped prepare young Saultites for both the challenges and opportunities of adult life . 
It is our responsibility as members of Parliament , and in a number of cases also as parents and grandparents , to ensure that each of our children in Canada does not live in poverty , die of hunger , fall victim to sexual abuse , or be exploited for the purpose of pornography or prostitution . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Industry . 
Hon. Christine Stewart ( Minister of the Environment , Lib . ) :

One gentleman said that he did not have enough money to purchase insulin because his EI cheque did not come . 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
That Bill C - 4 be amended by adding before line 4 on page 1 the following : 
I have no hesitation whatsoever in speaking favourably to Bill C - 4 in its original intent as passed by the committee of all parliamentarians . 
As the parliamentary secretary indicated , the government wishes to have the producers in charge of their own marketing corporation . 
How many lawyers are over there in your camp anyway ? 
I cannot see that happening in the bill , the way it is drafted. 
CANADA POST 
The judge must read after enacts . 
This monopoly was enshrined in the seventies into the wheat board act . 
This wheat board act historically has been a subject of much discussion in the constituency I represent , the constituency of Lethbridge , and obviously right across the prairies . 
We must also look at community action programs for children . 
As I stated earlier , these actions demonstrate that assistance to families with children , particularly low and modest income families , is and will continue to be a priority of the government . 
Under the seniors benefit the government says they do not have to pay tax for a family income of $ 11,000 , but a family of four has to pay tax .

Hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 20 , an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and related amendments to other acts . 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Eventually it will mean the destruction of the wheat board and the loss of the concept of the single desk selling agency . 
Those provinces can export their grain with these certificates but the other three provinces cannot . 
The minister of agriculture in Alberta pointed out a number of things in his letter that were wrong with the legislation . 
You listen up over there , you one Liberal. 
The big advantage of using the port of Churchill as I have vented in this House is that it is 6,800 kilometres shorter to European markets than it is from the Thunder Bay port . 
I am not sure whether he got caned but he certainly got locked up in irons and presumably locked up elsewhere for a long time . 
Everything is linked to crop results in other countries and the buying power of other countries , to international politics . 
That comes as no surprise . 
I asked a number of witnesses in committee whether the divisiveness among producers in western Canada would stop , whether they would be happy to go forward with the legislation . 
This morning ' s papers report that the Prime Minister revoked an appointment made by his predecessor , Lester B . Pearson . 
We do not know and farmers obviously do not know how big that contingency fund is going to have to be or how much they are going to have to pay for it . 
Meanwhile the 2,500 fishermen who have their fish marketed through this board are paying for that salary , which is about $ 103,000 , plus all the perks that go with this patronage appointment . 
Why not ship the wheat through Thunder Bay and then through the ports in Quebec ? 
DIABETES AWARENESS MONTH 
In Canada , and in Quebec , the number of poor children is growing at the same astounding rate as the number of millionaires . 
Mr. Speaker , we would like to see the minister table a report that would confirm the transparency of the process , as the Quebec government did in full compliance with the law . 
So do we . 
Mr. Speaker , at the moment that we speak and since last night talks have resumed. 
That is why at the last meeting of federal - provincial ministers of culture we agreed to establish a pilot program with the Canadian Council of Ministers of Education at its request because it said that we needed more material to teach Canadian about our own history . 
Bob Thompson served his country in Parliament and also in the Royal Canadian Air Force when Canada was engaged in pilot training during World War II. 
As for me , I shall miss the greatest political mentor of my life . 
I began to ask myself why they were supporting Bill C - 4 . 
I want to make that clear . 
I have to wonder just how far this government is willing to go to make sure every facet of society is kept broke . 
It does not seem to me that they want it . 
We want to have a board where we can be in or out . 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
I find it more than a bit strange that the more socialist people in this country , whenever a state run enterprise is under scrutiny , always fall back and say that it cannot exist in a free market economy . 
We will therefore vote in favour of this statement of good intention . 
Depending on how quorum is set by the minister , I have concern that a quorum could consist of all appointed directors . 
However , I am going to refer to two studies which I believe must be referred to when we are talking about the complete lack of success of the agreement on internal trade that was passed in 1995 . 
So , it is certainly not up to the federal Parliament to decide to impose rules without a consensus among the provinces involved. 
I would like to congratulate our government as well for making some early moves in the right direction . 
Consequently the government believes that it is wise to establish a reserve in the employment insurance account .

Licensing requirements and technical standards must be based on objective and transparent criteria and must not be more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service . 
With the new powers provided the CRTC under this bill , the government is ensuring that practices in Canada are in line with those abroad so that a clear and consistent process can be created to identify the players in the industry . 
Is there unanimous consent ? 
Mr. Speaker , global warming is a problem that every person , every country and every level of government in the world must deal with . 
Mr. Speaker , this is restorative justice week . 
Mr. Speaker , as the Minister of the Environment said here in the House of Commons , the government is currently consulting all interested parties in order to prepare Canada ' s position for the conference coming up in a few weeks . 
That is nonsense . 
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Could the parliamentary secretary assure the House that the amendments introduced to the Competition Act will be effective in ending this deplorable practice ? 
As a result of subsequent discussions with the member , I am convinced that it was not her intention to give that impression and I would like to withdraw my comments from yesterday . 
When the House broke for question period the hon. member for Calgary East had some moments left in his remarks . 
Most important is what precedent has this bill established for future parks . 
In fact , the marine park is in an extremely diversified and rich environment . 
The picks and shovels have been replaced by automated systems that have dramatically improved the efficiency of mining . 
To aid the corporation achieving its goal of profitability and competitiveness with other energy sources , the government has provided Devco with a repayable loan of up to $ 69 million over three years . 
In my view the development of the Donkin mine under the auspices of Devco is the best way to ensure successful adjustment that has long term benefits for Devco , employees , taxpayers and those who supported Devco operations throughout the years . 
That is why I am here , to push this government to help create jobs on Cape Breton Island .

Even if convicted people themselves do not appeal they are deemed to have appealed and the court will review the case on all questions of fact and law to determine if the conviction is valid. 
Madam Speaker , I feel compelled to participate in this debate on Bill C - 212 which was introduced by the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River . 
Exactly . 
Another reason to oppose this bill - and I am saying this on a personal basis today , but also , knowing rather well my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois , I believe there are a number of them that agree with me - is the possibility of an error in the judicial system . 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion ? 
It is interesting that the most effective and eloquent way of explaining the purpose and what we are doing comes not from long experienced parliamentarians , but oftentimes from the mouths of children . 
We settled for a situation that we knew the majority of the countries of the world would support . 
Only if we do this can we get the required changes to stop the international bureaucratic inertia in international foreign policy . 
I say almost exclusive because obviously it was not exclusive . 
Six million mines were deployed in Bosnia during the war and to date the UN estimates there are still 3 million mines left in Bosnia . 
We will wait and see , hoping that real progress is made . 
We must put to good use their gift to us and the sacrifices they made so that today we might enjoy the individual and political freedoms so dear to us and the democratic and responsible institutions of which we are so proud . 
Let the process work and let the parties come up with an agreement . 
Mr. Speaker , on Friday the finance minister announced a cut to EI premiums that works out to less than a dime a day for Canadians - 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
The code of ethics described there is for businesses that are not signed on and it is voluntary . 
My point of order concerns irregularities with certain of these estimates . 
The test which items must meet to be included in the Estimates is whether or not the government is putting forward a spending estimate under authority it already possesses , or whether it is really seeking new legislative authority to do something . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
The Deputy Speaker : 
This is meant to be consistent with the particular Criminal Code change which is being made . 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the answer . 
( On clause 11 ) 
There is another matter on which I should comment because I think we are helping consolidate law in the making . 
All of us realize how emotional and difficult that is . 
It is interesting to note that those who manufacture or order the deployment of land mines themselves are in no danger of losing life or limb to these land mines . 
And what about the economic tragedies caused by anti - personnel mines ? 
Yesterday U.S. President Bill Clinton at least had the courage to congratulate Canada and urged us to move forward with the treaty . 
Whether he suffered his injuries from a land mine is something I will never know , but it is clear that the land mines were responsible for many of the amputated limbs at that camp . 
The international non - government organization community has always argued that a ban on land mines is necessary because the mines actually violate international human rights and international law by killing or maiming over 20,000 civilians per year . 
It is unthinkable but nonetheless true that one quarter of the people treated for land mine injuries in Red Cross centres in Afghanistan and Cambodia are children . 
The job has been well started , but it will not end until we persuade even more countries to sign on . 
These devices do not affect rich countries like ours .

In each of the five cases identified the funds sought through the estimates process are needed for continuing operations of the programs concerned. 
Therein lies the problem with the vote tonight . 
I will repeat the motion so it is clear for all members of the House : 
One is a vigorous , inspiring and far - sighted vision for making federalism work better , a vision of a 21 st century Canada which appeals deeply to all Canadians , including Quebeckers . 
there is very strong support . 
But I do not want to look like the only one criticizing the Calgary declaration , so I am going to quote from a number of newspaper articles I have come across recently . 
I do not quarrel with the principle . 
People will not be able to explain what the Calgary declaration is , or what Meech Lake is , if they have no bread on the table . 
We recognize in our own policy that all provinces have to work together to make the federation stronger . 
The Liberals have left it out and the Tories have left it out . 
We may come to realize that we must work more closely together to be stronger and more receptive to our various needs as citizens of a specific province , or as members of a specific linguistic , religious or cultural group . 
While the declaration is not a legal draft nor a proposal for a constitutional amendment , we believe it is an important step in the right direction . 
We have seen rumblings in the maritimes . 
For decades we have used our differences to pull ourselves apart. 
One of the areas within the Constitution the prime minister was passionately committed to was the whole are of national programs . 
Mr. Speaker , last week Cambridge lost a very caring and committed councillor who served the community for almost 30 years . 
Let Albertans elect a senator who will represent them . 
Miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I am very aware of the issues the hon. member has alluded to . 
I have made it very plain that I will respond to the standing committee report - 
The department is watching the results of that intervention very closely . 
It is a great society that must stay within Canada . 
It really falls outside the realm of the committee because it was external to the committee . 
That is what we are doing . 
Mr. Speaker , I was very interested to hear the member ' s comments . 
Mr. Speaker , I praise the openmindedness of my colleague who was elected to the Quebec National Assembly and who saw the Meech Lake accord die . 
( Motion agreed to ) 
The development of this great Canada did not begin in the west and move east , but began in the east and moved west . 
There is no ringing declaration in the BNA Act that Canada wants to be a bilingual and bicultural country . 
Supported by the hon. member for Langley - Abbotsford , the hon. member argued that the first five items seek to bypass the legislative process because certain bills related thereto are now before the House or died on the order paper in the 35 th Parliament . 
No. 
Is there unanimous consent ? 
( Clause 4 agreed to ) 
Mr. Speaker , I believe you will find unanimous consent for the members who voted on the previous motion to be recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House , with Liberal members voting yea . 
Street prostitutes are not afraid of getting caught , nor are they deterred in any way to give up this dark and sad way of living .

I am going to let you say something but then I am going to come back to this . 
The Department of Justice stayed the proceedings on the grounds that evidence had come to the attention of the crown counsel handling the case , after the charges were laid and before the trial , that provided the company with a clear defence of officially induced error to the charges .

The second amendment I am moving in Group No. 1 is Motion No. 24 . 
It is a matter of transparency and accountability . 
It shows that , as far as Quebeckers are concerned , the main pension plan is the Quebec pension plan . 
Members and other Canadians may recall members of Parliament who preceded us in this Chamber , members in high regard , members like Major James Coldwell , a CCF member of Parliament from Regina . 
People who have money , who have companies registered offshore , who have family trusts and all of those good things can diversify their assets to the point where this rule does not substantially hurt them . 
I like that one about Reform getting at the grassroots .

The men and women in the army have differences , but we call them soldiers . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
I came to Canada in 1957 when I was 10 years old . 
This is what makes up the people of Canada . 
No. Despite the reality of dirty air in many cities of the developing world and incredibly high populations , it is still the developed world that accounts for 58 % of global carbon dioxide emissions . 
In 1988 however - and I am talking mainly about the North American context ; you can follow a line of development in Europe and other parts of the world - the global warming theory regained attention from testimony before the U.S. Senate energy subcommittee of the commerce committee by James Hansen , head of NASA ' s Goddard Institute for Space Studies . 
It fails to provide regional impact assessments . 
Number five , if no such agreement is reached , do not sign . 
This is why an independent compliance committee composed of experts and private citizens should be created to ensure that , within Canada , the federal government and the provinces follow up on the commitments made in Kyoto through periodic public reports . 
It is not as if we were waiting for some kind of invention to know what to do . 
I will speak to some of the comments of our colleague , the leader of the Reform Party , who based all his arguments on science . 
The latest was in 1966 at the Geneva conference that resulted in the declaration calling for commitments to control emissions in a post - 2000 era to be legally binding . 
That is the first principle we would like to see the government adopt as it goes to this conference and emerges with a position . 
We are not interested in seeing any province or region or sector bearing a disproportionate burden . 
We can take various scenarios . 
Indeed , our grandchildren , even in this blessed nation , will be experiencing a very severely deteriorated quality of life if we continue on our present course . 
That is why there must be an international agreement between all countries , in order to reduce these emissions , which are creating a sort of Thermos bottle effect . 
There is also the tradable permits . 
Madam Speaker , I rise tonight to speak on this very important issue affecting all Canadians and indeed all people in the world . 
This government ' s record cannot even begin to match what was accomplished for the environment when our party and our leader were in government . 
Over the last while we have had numerous scientists come to us as witnesses . 
Mr. Speaker , I am not sure where the question was but certainly that erudite body the hon. member referred to is entitled to its opinion , as are all other Canadians . 
Frederick Selz is a director of the Marshall institute . 
Reducing greenhouse gases is a very complex global issue . 
It never took its responsibility seriously or the government shuns accountability and it has something to hide . 
Addressing the issue of climate change means doing things smarter and in many cases saving money in the process . 
Nothing is static on this earth and nothing that petty little man can do is going to make a major difference in the vastness of space . 
All of these things , including the very existence of our cities , have already affected climate . 
Because the company was profitable . 
Developing countries are responsible for 40 % of the world emissions .

I would particularly like to recognize the efforts and the commitment of the police community in helping to keep the public informed about the organized crime problem and providing us with advice on how to address it . 
As I referred to a while ago , there is a very heavy concentration of biker gangs in Quebec . 
A $ 10,000 reporting rule is not only my position but that of the party and it is the position of the solicitor general himself who just less than two months ago made a speech to the U.S. - Canada cross - border crime forum . 
Agreed. 
The consistency will remain but will always continue to be held under review to ensure the best possible arrangements are available not only to the Canada pension plan but to all Canadians . 
That concerns me as a Canadian . 
I think previous members speaking in opposition to this do not realize that economic indicators are major cycles . 
Participants said a higher rate of return on investment is a prerequisite for the changes to the benefits and contributions . 
The federal government wants to limit eligibility to those who have contributed for four of the last six years , which ought to cut back considerably on eligibility to the plan . 
The answer is very simple . 
It represents , however , a large threat to the three components of the existing system . 
However , this 1997 CPP rate is an increase , as I said , after the existing rate was confirmed a year ago . 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) : 
They too got their just reward ; in the maritime provinces in particular , where seasonal unemployment is widespread , election results spoke volumes . 
In 1997 dollars , the federal government invested $ 6.7 billion in 1984 , compared to $ 5.1 billion this year . 
These negotiations have been going on for over seven months .

When is he telling the truth , before or after ? 
It was not irregular for the RCMP to engage in discussions with the province and the municipality in the event those legislative actions were taken . 
We are doing very well . 
Where the taxes are high , growth is low and there are fewer jobs . 
Establishing a cap of 10.25 % is clearly inconsistent with the CPP financing principles set out in the act . 
And the third one is a series of changes to certain benefits , such as the disability benefits . 
( b ) deleting lines 8 and 9 on page 31 . 
My motion would make it more progressive . 
No wonder Canadians think the government cannot add . 
Therefore they diminish their pension for the years they need it the most . 
Motion No. 14 put forward by the Conservatives calls for the same thing and we will vote against it essentially for the same reasons as those for which we will vote against Motions Nos. 13 and 15 put forward by the NDP . 
The Canada pension plan looks after workers . 
There is a balance of a process of arbitrage which makes these issues not as black and white as the member may indicate . 
Mr. Speaker , when I was on the campaign trail , and maybe when you were there as well , Reformers did not have an answer . 
I come back to my introduction . 
I will tell him , and I take exception to the statement , the useful information that is coming to this House right now is coming in the form of public consultations directly with Canadians through round tables , through town halls that members of Parliament conduct in their constituencies . 
We could give more powers to the auditor general to make his recommendations a much more meaningful part of our decision making process . 
I would not think of giving the finger to the hon. member , but I was warning him that he had a minute left in his speech . 
Mr. Pierre Brien

Middle income seniors who have made sacrifices and wise financial choices about their retirements are being punished. 
It implements a series of tax conventions between Canada and other countries in order to avoid double taxation . 
It is now before the House and we must deal with this as quickly as possible . 
Founded by an outstanding community leader , Max Keeping , Child & Youth Friendly Ottawa is run in partnership with young people . 
What went wrong on the way to Kyoto ? 
I understand the concerns of Canadians about whether appropriate procedures were followed. 
Mr. Speaker , the government has set up distribution centres for government cheques but in sprawling rural areas that does not work . 
Hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
I am sorry that the leader of the Conservative Party is not concerned about public safety . 
The labour force survey , source of Canada ' s official unemployment estimates , does not include data on ethnic origin . 
I have some questions about legislation as it comes before the House . 
Madam Speaker , I have just heard the admission I need. 
It heard from two national organizations representing co - operatives , the Canadian Co - operative Association and the Conseil canadien de la coop é ration . 
That tells me that there is a ray of hope here . 
The farmers decided to band together to gain better control over the marketing of their products and purchases . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Books are for learning and improving . 
Yet those on the ideological left are often heard calling for a higher capital gains tax . 
The GST was designed to raise no more money than the hidden tax it replaced. 
In reality , the majority of these graduates are 17 and 18 . 
Mr. John Maloney 
Hon. Jim Peterson 
Motion No. 23 negatived 
They are not stumbling blocks but little bumps on the road that need to be ironed out . 
A number of questions have been raised regarding the Canada Post Corporation ' s operations and its funding . 
The private sector competes with many of the services offered by Canada Post . 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
In fact , the House will find that the number of motions is far above the average that we would normally see for a bill . 
The survivors benefit will also be reduced. 
I believe this is its Achilles heel and the public will react when they find out what the politicians have done to them . 
It would be a good idea if the money from the pension fund that we are proposing would actually go to pensioners , but it is not . 
Once blood has been shed and economies destroyed the seeds for future conflicts are sown for generations to come . 
His faith in bargaining has been misplaced and now the government is going to legislate . 
Mr. Speaker , how much more do they want ? 
If she thinks we should have export sales support as does the U.S. , my answer to her is that we do . 
Hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it is very interesting that the member forgot to mention that when the premier of Quebec visited France , he specifically requested the federal government to back off and back away from any WTO challenge . 
Reading this report , which was leaked by the Toronto media , we can see that the Liberals are attempting to pass it off as an objective summary of what the numerous organizations and individuals consulted since mid - October from coast to coast had to say . 
I hope that he would choose to withdraw an allegation like that . 
After being read a second time , the said bill shall be referred to a committee of the whole ; and 
This year alone , excluding the Senate , there were 50 patronage appointments made by the government . 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to join in this debate on Bill C - 2 , the Canada pension plan . 
Couples stress over money and it does affect the children . 
This House must quickly go through the democratic process to approve the increased contributions proposed , even if they hurt . 
This government has decided in its own wisdom to stop the debate , " Let ' s not give anybody an opportunity to talk about the pros and cons '' . 
It being 5.15 p.m. , pursuant to order made earlier today , it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the report stage of the bill now before the House .

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Early intervention to take away the right would be contrary to the spirit of the law and would discourage the parties from any serious attempts at settling their own differences . 
Some people have asked what exactly it involves . 
Every time , the Prime Minister , or the Minister of Labour who got up ever so calmly and told us , about 50 times , " Yes , yes , just leave the process alone , let things work themselves out . 
The interference at that point was failing to come to the bargaining table in a reasonable amount of time . 
Mr. Speaker , I have a couple of comments to make and a question for the member . 
The United Way of Greater Toronto estimates that it is out $ 1 million from its direct mail campaign this year . 
Talk about the children of this country . 
But where the attitude is and written in the national constitution that Canada Post is not to control Canada Post any longer , then legislation had to be brought in . 
Why are we seeing such a rise in the militancy of the labour movement ? 
We support the rank and file . 
We told the government time and time again prior to the strike that it was going to happen . 
In fact , they have a short term vision and they never propose anything to help find a permanent solution to the Canada Post issue . 
I care and the government cares about those individuals and the charities . 
In order to become efficient , the Canada Post Corporation wants to be able to change the itinerary of its letter carriers and find internal solutions .

Let us get some of this freight off the highways and back on the rails where it belongs . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
The banks have spent millions to plant one question . 
I have taken steps .

The title therefore has great meaning , seeing Canada whole . 
Still , our postal service , like our whole society , is going through a period of intensive changes . 
There is nothing new , as a lot of people know . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
In fact , the member should realize that , for the first time in the history of the Canada Post Corporation , we have a strike with no violence on the picket lines . 
The arbitration panel shall notify both parties in writing of the location at which final positions must be filed including the precise date and time of the deadline for filing . 
Mr. Pat Martin : 
It is important that we , as parliamentarians , have the courage to say and to reaffirm this . 
I would like to add that Canada Post must have sufficient flexibility to manage in a competitive environment . 
That is the first point. 
Mr. Chairman , I will be very brief . 
We must follow the rules of the Treasury Board . 
The division on the amendment stands deferred. 
The Chairman : 
On division . 
I would like to stress that the importance of this arrangement was also recognized by Canada Post and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers and they agreed to a process for delivering these cheques in the event of a work stoppage . 
As I have said before in this House , I believe that that is a tool that could be used effectively by labour and by management . 
As the successor to the GATT , since 1995 , the WTO has acquired supranational powers and is out of reach of the controls of parliamentary democracy . 
So , what happened should not come as a surprise . 
How do they have the nerve to go on strike , to ask for more , to demand job security or to demand that the jobs which are already there be protected ? 
Mr. Denis Coderre : 
And as for Quebec , I will always defend it . 
Of all those who called me , 76 % said they agreed. 
Mr. Lynn Myers : 
A lot of people have fax machines , so they do not care if Canada Post is out on strike . 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to the special order made yesterday , I am pleased to move : 
NATIONAL DEFENCE 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
May the week of the disabled raise our awareness of that reality . 
The leader of the official opposition . 
When we look at the extraordinary results we are having with this strategy we realize that we have developed the right tools to help youth with the transition from school to work . 
Mr. Speaker , the auditor general deplores the fact that the foundation is not required to submit to Parliament an annual report on how it uses this $ 800 million . 
This is a 25 % shortfall . 
Mr. Guy St - Julien : 
I think the point has been discussed enough , my colleague . 
The Cassiar asbestos mine in British Columbia has not been reopened. 
" matters and zoning by - laws that apply to neighbouring lands . " 
We contend , therefore , that the bill must be amended so that special situations , like that of the Quebec City region , are given special solutions . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
In discussions with the premier of the province of New Brunswick in early August this year , he denied flatly to me as a member of Parliament that this group out of New Jersey and New York had any design on taking over the Bayside port . 
Mr. Stan Keyes : 
The chairman of the pilotage authority will be part time or full time and appointed by governor in council in consultation with the users and the authority . 
The consummate insider . 
I thank members opposite for their participation in this stage of the bill and in this block of amendments . 
These employees , some with 10 or 15 years of service , will be left out in the cold . 
We believe that that is taxation without representation . 
These user fees are a type of hidden tax that the Minister of Finance approves . 
Cross - subsidization should not be occurring . 
Madam Speaker , if you were to seek it , I believe that you would find unanimous consent for the following motion : 
The federal government has a role to play in bringing together provincial and territorial partners and a range of other interests to develop a national plan and timetable for introducing prescription drugs into the medicare system . 
Introduction and first reading 
Mr. Preston Manning 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
In the ruling which I delivered on October 9 , 1997 , I indicated that while this was a matter of considerable importance , it did not constitute a breach of privilege . 
The petitioners therefore pray and call upon Parliament to pursue tax initiatives that would assist parents who choose to provide care in the home for preschool children . 
Let me take a few moments to refute some of the myths being spread by members of the other side of this House and by some special interest groups . 
Furthermore , this legislation is being pushed through the House by the Liberal majority without proper and sufficient democratic debate before the Canadian people . 
But we have 12 hand picked Liberal appointees who will wield enormous influence in our economy . 
The two opposing provinces disagreed with a specific aspect , not the reform as a whole . 
A solution had to be found and , more importantly , applied. 
As I said , we do have some problems with the plan . 
There would be a different level of fairness . 
That was courtesy ? 
I do not know where the member has been . 
The benefits received by Canadian beneficiaries rose substantially whereas the premiums did not track those increased benefits . 
As a matter of fact , I sat on one of those committees between 1988 and 1993 where we reviewed what the Canada pension plan needed to have done to it and the Tories basically decided to do nothing because they were afraid of the political consequences . 
According to the finance department itself , we have a paper from Joe Italiano in the finance department saying higher payroll taxes are going to kill tens of thousands of jobs . 
Out of fairness , that should be pointed out . 
That is why we have a system for everyone to invest in their own retirement savings plan . 
The hon. member for St. Paul ' s . 
Let us hope that he will at least appreciate certain benefits of Canadian federalism when he sees that Canada ' s economic strength benefits Quebec in such circumstances . 
We have serious differences with the Reform Party , as the hon. member can see every day , but we share one and the same country , one that needs to be preserved , and preserve it we will , regardless of our disagreements . 
Mr. G é rard Asselin ( Charlevoix , BQ ) : 
* * * 
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) : 
Sometimes in the heat of debate words are exchanged. 
This government and our counterparts in the eight provincial capitals have a plan . 
Our party will be proposing improvements to the bill , through our critic , the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques . 
That is why the government called on young people to take part in the consultations that preceded the development of these proposals . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Is the member suggesting that the work of Stanley Knowles in helping to shape and create a universal pension plan is not significant , is not worthy of note or is not there to guide us in the future ? 
The sixteenth CPP actuarial report prepared by federal chief actuary Bernard Dussault projects a total cumulative reduction in CPP spending on disability pensions by the year 2005 of over $ 1 billion - 
We recently announced our intention to introduce a national child benefit to fight child poverty . 
Members 
The Speaker : 
YEAS 
This is what he had to say about phthalates . 
My minister , the minister responsible for the health and well - being of Canadian children , has already assured this House , and I repeat that assurance , that if at any time clear evidence of health risks from phthalates are established , appropriate action will be taken to protect the health of children and I dare say with alacrity . 
I cannot believe that the government would not be proactive as well and want to give this advice to anyone who may be at risk . 
For all these reasons , the safety of our children , the health of the economy , it is important for the government to recognize this problem and accept my hon. colleague ' s suggestion and place labels on toys polluted by phthalates as soon as possible . 
Following such scientific scrutiny they were then provided to the first nations , which I am told had expressed an interest in receiving them . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay 
Mr. Michel Guimond 
The Chair would also draw members ' attention to the fact that the subcommittee may select an item as votable at any time before it is taken up by the House . 
It complements the government ' s other transportation initiatives and is also an important element of the overall effort to prepare our transportation system for the next century . 
We have been steamrolled , but because we do not want the shipping industry to be left in limbo with no legislation at all , we will support it . 
The centre trains women as designers and sewers and with the help of a Hamilton entrepreneur markets the garments across Canada . 
I call on all members of this House to reflect on the lives lost in Montreal and renew their commitment to end all forms of violence . 
The Calgary declaration makes it clear that this is not special status . 
Mr. Speaker , the wealth of Canadian households is up . 
Unfortunately , the only government that did not and will not take part in this process is the Government of Quebec . 
The Tobacco Act puts Canada in a position of leadership throughout the world for vigorous and effective steps to reduce the incidence of tobacco use among its citizens and of that we are very proud . 
I have to honour to table in the House , in both official languages , the second edition of the book entitled Parliamentary Privilege in Canada , written by Joseph Maingot , the former Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel in the House of Commons . 
Depending on how the Chair deals with this case , I would like the Chair to consider that as an option to deal with this issue once and for all so we do not have any repeated incidents of this kind . 
We have to come together to implement initiatives which work . 
Invariably there will be one member in the House who will say no , and the unanimous consent is denied. 
POVERTY 
No sooner was the election over than there was a little political appointment to the port of Quebec City board of directors . 
Other jurisdictions , the United States being one example but there are many others , have experimented with similar privatization schemes for their ports and have had to re - evaluate their actions in the face of increases in criminal activities in those other countries and to reinstate specialized port police and take back control of the ports . 
It is very tightly controlled. 
It is an enormous step forward . 
Those in the public service must serve , and if they betray the public trust they must be held accountable . 
On the subject of tainted blood specifically , the commissioner calls the lawmakers to task saying that the deplorable examples of measures taken by officials to destroy information had sounded the alarm . 
Mr. Speaker , since my speech is extemporaneous , I shall address the question in a general term with respect to justice and doing things that are right in the country . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan 
Mrs. Monique Guay 
Mr. Gerry Byrne 
Our current drop - out rate in Canada is approximately 30 % . Drop - outs have an unemployment rate in excess of 25 % and represent over 50 % of youth unemployment . 
We did not have central heating . 
As far as possible the law should support the institution of marriage and require divorcing couples to meet their responsibilities and obligations . 
I conclude my comments by thanking hon. members for putting their views on the floor . 
There is nothing in proposed term 17 that would hamper an individual ' s freedom to choose or to practice their religion . 
B ) All such colleges shall receive their share of any grant from time to time voted for all colleges then being conducted under authority of the legislature , such grant being distributed on a non - discriminatory basis . 
The idea that the denominational school is to be differentiated from the common school purely by the character of its religious exercises or religious studies is erroneous . 
It is the Government of Newfoundland that will make the decisions on the structure that will be implemented , on parent committees and everything else , so that from now on it will be a public system and no longer a denominational system . 
If it had been clearly demonstrated to us that the Pentecostal Church was for the amendment , there would have been much less debate and difficulty . 
The catholic and Pentecostal denominations received an injunction from the Newfoundland supreme court , which agreed that implementing the new model was a violation of their constitutionally guaranteed rights . 
ARMENIAN EARTHQUAKE 
Indeed some would say it is democracy itself . 
The hon. Minister of Finance . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
That is why this government has taken a number of actions , including our statement on organized crime . 
Thompson should not get a salary if he does not show up for work . 
In accordance with its mandate under Standing Order 108 , your committee undertook the consideration of climate change issues in relation to Canadian preparations and participation at the conference of the parties of the UN convention on climate change presently sitting in Kyoto . 
Professor Donald J . Fleming of the University of New Brunswick , faculty of law , and Dr. Patrick Malcolmson , associate professor of political science from St. Thomas University in Fredericton , had earlier given presentations on the legal implications of the new proposed term 17 . 
From the day it announced the referendum , government utilized public moneys and resources to finance and support its own campaign but it gave absolutely nothing to the other side . 
These people are the true minorities of Newfoundland and Labrador . 
Does the member suggest the religious education that will take place in Newfoundland under the new terms will be a menu of values and principles so that there is no particular common consensus ? 
The hon. member opposite suggested that the question was unclear . 
Parents of faith will once again wonder whether Canada has freedom of religion or freedom from religion . 
Let me read again : " Do you support a single school system where all children , regardless of their religious affiliation , attend the same schools where opportunities for religious education and observances are provided , yes or no ? " 
It will definitely not be up to the Canadian Parliament to get involved in this area of jurisdiction . 
Then the member from the government side responded to that debate . 
They have confidence in their own denominational faith . 
It was handcuffed. 
We have a quick question , 30 seconds and a 30 second response . 
For the Reform Party not to want to listen to the people is clearly astounding to see . 
Yes , I do know most of the members of the Newfoundland legislature . 
Mr. Ted White : 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member from Humber - St. 
If they had wanted to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that their own denomination were opposed to the changes and if they thought they had a sufficiently large number of people within their own denomination that would vote against it , then it behooved the representatives of these denominations to ask that the vote be done by denominational class , and that was not done . 
There was an injunction . 
No one attempted to take political advantage . 
That is why we need a very high standard to alienate such rights . 
I am of the belief that the technical and legal language needs to concur with the form of the question . 
There have been arguments on both sides that have dealt with the fairness of the procedures used by the government in obtaining its mandate to reform the school system . 
Certainly the members of the committee , including those who supported the majority report to make a recommendation to the House and to the Senate that the requested resolution be passed , had a great deal of empathy and sympathy for those people who came before the committee and indicated that they did not wish to see these denominational rights extinguished. 
I am saying the same thing for the province of Newfoundland . 
In 1982 , when the charter came in , we saw all kinds of new things added to the charter of rights and freedoms which a lot of Canadians would probably disagree with . 
The point is that people who believe strongly in these things came out and voted against it . 
I would argue that sometimes by neglect , by not teaching positive things we end up allowing negative things to become part of what our children believe . 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Ms. Libby Davies 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 47 
The Chair had difficulty with one aspect of the motion . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Speaker , on a point of order . 
We are debating the original motion and the amendment is on the floor . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Andr é Harvey : 
Mr. Speaker , I welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C - 17 as it enters its final stage in this House . 
We ought therefore to be extremely vigilant . 
We all know the Liberals stood in the House hour after hour , night after night , pounding the table against free trade . 
Let me conclude in the minute that I have left to indicate that Bill C - 17 flowed from a number of free trade agreements and free trade type agreements that it puts into place to the commitments that Canada made in those deals . 
Of even greater concern is the report ' s conclusion that the gap between the rich and the poor is increasing . 
Miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians will be happy to know that after pursuing many of our past ideas he has now decided to pursue our new ones . 
* * * 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) : 
My colleague says " Especially the NDP '' . 
This tax and spend approach that the co - op membership realized is the same as Canadians are realizing , that it is putting at risk our social programs . 
Another example I want to share with my colleagues in the House of Commons and other people who are watching is that the co - op movement is not dying . 
As we are well aware , a number of changes are required to compete in this globalized world in which we now live . 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
And what is the independence of the judiciary ? 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
If it is not , I would like to refer to the words of one of Canada ' s most respected sons , Chief Justice Brian Dickson . 
PAIRED 
Is it agreed that the Minister of Finance ' s name be deleted and the vote on Bill C - 9 agreed to ? 
Also , the British Columbia and other provincial ministers further requested to increase the age of consent to sexual activity to 16 . 
I also appeal to the federal Liberal government , in addition to supporting the $ 375 million transition program , to take a strong and constructive stand on the ongoing concern around the salmon treaty . 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY 
STATUS OF WOMEN 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur 
Despite these real advances , however , there is still much to be done . 
Women have used the charter to challenge legislation which discriminates against them . 
In addition , is the member saying that the provinces did not want us to help students with their debt load ? 
If it is true , who is right ? 
The Deputy Prime Minister told us that it was not the Liberals ' problem . 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Pursuant to the order of reference of Thursday , October 30 , 1997 , your committee has considered the draft regulations on firearms and your committee has agreed to report it with recommendations .

About one - third of the foreign held debt rests with U.S. investors , with the remainder divided mainly between European and Japanese investors . 
I receive some 2,000 letters a month on average , but her letter was one of the best I have ever received. 
Note the spending on essentials , wood and groceries for the family . 
Scrooge found himself once again in the taxicab , hurtling this time down a lonely country road . 
Mr. Yvan Bernier : 
Now it says it has no money , that this is not the way to do things , that it will cut off families and children and that they will no longer be entitled to eat . 
I hope that this bill is deemed votable and the government supports your initiative . 
This is why we oppose Bill C - 215 as written , since it removes any time frame . 
As for me , my support and my efforts will be to the benefit of the victim at every opportunity . 
Mr. Speaker , on November 19 last , I asked the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food a question on the future of the dairy industry . 
On that I rest my case . 
Mr. Paul Szabo 
Miss Deborah Grey 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the third report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts . 
There clearly was not consent and in the circumstances we are unable to proceed with the motions . 
It is what he proposes now to do with the debt . 
The private sector is understandably concerned about the fact that the Government of Canada has gone pell - mell into the privatization of our ports without understanding that there must be a commitment from the government in the investment of the ports and make sure the infrastructure is there . 
Any tax increase is wrong . 
Many governments , organizations and corporations have now cleaned up their act . 
It is an enormous sector . 
They cannot afford to buy gas , insurance , licence plates and all that . 
Mr. Allan Kerpan ( Blackstrap , Ref. ) : 
I do not understand how he can stand up without blushing and call for tax cuts across the board when what this government is doing is providing incentives , proper programs , proper dividends and proper assistance for people who need the assistance . 
Mr. Ren é Laurin ( Joliette , BQ ) : 
The Liberals ought to listen to constituents in their own ridings like we in the Reform Party listen to the ones in ours . 
If this is the definitive analysis of the Bloc Quebecois on this debate on public finances , the upcoming budget and the choices to be made , I would like to know how they can point to dissent based on the idea of having to separate from Canada while listening to the eminent spokespersons of the Quebec government , the minister of finance and even the Quebec premier say that the federal government cannot be allowed to destroy Canada ' s Constitution . 
There was no consent . 
Not over a million , but 200,000 jobs have been filled. 
Mr. Larry McCormick ( Hastings - Frontenac - Lennox and Addington , Lib . ) : 
For the past 40 years , Soeur Lorette has been directing Les Jeunes Chanteurs de l ' Acadie , a choir of young people from the Greater Moncton area . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
The closing of the bridge was never discussed with CN in our negotiations to find a solution to the financing of the project before work begins . 
I did not say that anybody broke rules . 
Notwithstanding that the government has bungled this Kyoto deal , notwithstanding that it has angered half the premiers in Canada , and notwithstanding that it continued to tax Canadians to death , will the Deputy Prime Minister convey to the Prime Minister , Madame Chr é tien and his colleagues the best wishes of the official opposition for the Christmas season ? 
At that time , the Speaker warned the government that he would not treat similar situations lightly . 
Some hon. members : 
What is the government doing about it ? 
Nelson for finance minister . 
While the federal government was cutting back drastically on social programs to fight the war on the deficit , and while other provincial governments were doing the same , one province was not . 
Many jobs became precarious because of all these changes . 
I am not a mathematician , certainly not in answering the question on how someone is going to get a bypass , but let me say one thing . 
The finance minister feels that once the economic crisis which is being dealt with on the backs of ordinary Canadians is under control , the government has the right to dictate to taxpayers how their money should be spent . 
Members of the committee ensured that the perspectives of Canadians were brought forward and were part of the analysis in putting together the report . 
Allow me , if I may , to comment on the first and general ideas here , the commitment to fiscal integrity which was the key point in the present government ' s successful campaign in 1993 : balance the budget and reduce the external debt . 
FAMOUS FIVE 
I do not believe that . 
They were young people at the time . 
The MacKenzie - Papineau Battalion , named after the leaders of the 1837 rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada , was made up of 1,300 Canadian volunteers who served in the international brigades to support the Republican government against the authority of fascist dictator General Franco during the Spanish Civil War , between 1936 and 1939 . 
Since the Quebec North Shore & Labrador Railway handed the freight monopoly over to the private sector , rates have more than doubled. 
HELICOPTERS 
First Reading 
Who are we to decide ? 
The former leader of the Bloc Quebecois , Lucien Bouchard , stated : " Like many Canadians , I was asking questions . 
On Wednesday the bus would go to the Swan cottage . 
The questions may be simple ; the answers certainly are not . 
In response to the provinces ' request for flexibility we restructured the previous system with its separate targeted components into a single Canada health and social transfer . 
Let us resolve to give Canadians back some control . 
That is unbelievable to me . 
Mr. Speaker , I suspect that over the holidays you read this bill carefully just as the rest of us did. 
I want to comment on the speeches made by the Reform Party members who have spoken on the legislation . 
Again , when this government talks about education reform , it is talking about these types of stop - gap adjustments to the RESP , the changes in the allowable deductions for students . 
He talked about a by province floor . 
Although it is true we went without electricity , we were not however without power , the power of generosity , kindness , compassion , honesty , courage and community spirit . 
Mr. Speaker , the prime minister came out of the same hole he went into last December . 
We are not in a rush to make any decision until we have received the report of the committee . 
The fact is other banks are not going to sit around and wait while the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal eat their lunch for them . 
In consideration of their future , will the Minister of Finance stamp the monster merger as NSF and tell the banks that the deal has no serious future in Canada ? 
POINTS OF ORDER 
Mr. Speaker , I believe what we often deal with in this House is not black , it is not white , it is grey and this is one of those grey areas that you will have to deal with . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
I do not really think many Canadians would call that an excessive and exorbitant contribution to helping resolve the problem of the national debt , which affects us all . 
The question I would like to ask my colleague concerns the banks . 
In 1975 in the world ranking of income per person Canada was number three . 
An hon. member opposite says " You had better not get sick '' . 
Order , please . 
A strong case was made to restore funding for our social humanities and medical research granting agencies . 
It is said that these surpluses could reach $ 8 billion . 
Had we not done the things we did when we did them , we might be in front of this House today asking for further cuts instead of asking this House to approve a reinvestment into a Canadian priority . 
As I recall , when he was asked why certain contracts did not go to certain provinces , the Prime Minister answered something like this : " Well , see , we have called for bids and the lowest bidder won . " 
We have proposed to reduce those payments by some 12 % which is hardly the 100 % she suggests . 
The NDP , on the other hand , will say that is not enough . 
They should have to apply from outside Canada like all the other people who come here . 
THE LATE SENATOR GERALD OTTENHEIMER 
Mr. Alex Shepherd 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Canadians want to ensure levers are in place so that the federal government can ensure the Canada Health Act is enforced. 
The province of Ontario would receive tax credits under this legislation of $ 5 billion . 
We are very concerned about this and we feel that the recent cuts in the transfer payments have seriously affected education and have caused a lot of problems for young people . 
In the private sector it is only businesses that provide good quality products that will prosper and thrive . 
Bill C - 28 is another example of a caring Liberal government . 
We hope the Minister of Human Resources Development will consider the six bills we introduced so that the reform may be changed. 
I am going to say something else about this whole system . 
I must remind the members that there is a rule of relevancy in our debate today , as always . 
This is the second concrete move by the government toward securing a world class education system , with the creation of the millennium scholarship fund recently announced in the Speech from the Throne . 
This bill allocates $ 1.5 billion extra to the Canada health and social transfer . 
Memorial University in Newfoundland is one of the premier educators in Canada . 
The first area is the Canada health and social transfer , a critical part of the bill . 
Then again , what does the finance minister know about paying taxes ? 
I would like , once again , to thank these linesmen , all these workers whom we do not know by name but who are dear to our hearts. 
He went on to become party leader . 
I would like the member to tell us whether he thinks they will agree to a debate on the question here in the Parliament of Canada . 
They have played politics with public safety and now they are trying to weasel out of it . 
I was extremely available . 
JUSTICE 
Second , the House could decide to send the issue to committee where it could be debated and appropriate action determined. 
Page 221 of Joseph Maingot ' s Parliamentary Privilege in Canada describes a prima facie case of privilege in the parliamentary sense as one where the evidence on its face , as outlined by the member , is sufficiently strong for the House to be asked to debate the matter and to send it to a committee to investigate whether the privileges of the House have been breached or a contempt has even occurred. 
This lady is trying to raise a child on $ 15,000 a year . 
He knows the actions of his government lead to the poverty and to the strained circumstances in family after family in the armed forced. 
So there is a loophole , an error . 
These cuts hurt the provinces , which have had to deal with crises in the sectors of education , health and social programs . 
What I heard was fantastic . 
It was only to enact it once but it forget to say that it would be once a year . 
I could get Mr. Young . 
Some hon. members : 
Let us consider the best interests of the offender and public safety be damned. 
The hon. member has also cited examples where he says a police office cannot take timely action when he or she encounters an offender who is violating a condition of release . 
Such a mandate would allow police to return the offender to custody until his case can be examined by the National Parole Board . 
Joseph Fredericks was on parole at the time and a condition of his parole was that he stay away from children . 
Aboriginal inclusion in Canada ' s economic prosperity is important not only for aboriginal people but for all Canadians . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Mr. Bill Blaikie 
HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Loud and clear , they affirmed the right of the Quebec people to freely determine its own future . 
When he got booted out of Parliament last summer , he bought that same highway for a toll road for himself . 
Can the Prime Minister tell us whether it is the policy of his government to charge for highways twice , or whether he does not instead intend to ask the Government of New Brunswick to return the $ 32 million taken from Canadian taxpayers ' pockets ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
He was also minister of finance and he is on the board of Great - West Life ? 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order with respect to Bill S - 4 , an act to amend the Canada Shipping Act , which was sent from the Senate on Monday , February 2 . 
I had the privilege of serving in this House with Mark for some 16 years . 
I have never heard a bad word about Bruce '' . 
Mr. Orlikow worked with various NGOs from the John Howard Society to the Elizabeth Fry , the Jewish Labour Committee and the Canadian Labour Congress . 
Agreed. 
Mr. Speaker , just for clarification , I understood the motion was put forth in a way that did not specify without debate . 
It will be well known to you , Mr. Speaker , that the Iraqi government has refused to co - operate with the inspection teams mandated by the United Nations to eliminate the Iraqi ability to produce and use large quantities of chemical and other weapons of mass destruction . 
Many people commented on the bill when my hon. colleague introduced it in the House . 
For that reason I urge members of this House to vote against this bill . 
We currently have approximately 600,000 people . 
There are times when we realize that our status as Canadians goes far beyond our geography , our citizenship and our common history . 
People from across the country donated mats , cots , blankets , food , portable generators , firewood and money . 
The Bloc Quebecois has done everything in its power to ensure that the federal government helps everyone as much as possible , by enabling the victims of the storm to receive employment insurance benefits for the days of work they lost , ensuring that farmers get help and having the mail delivered on the weekend , for example . 
The ice storm showed us that social bond is not broken in our hearts , not yet anyway . 
I think this disaster helped us realize how some people around us live from pay cheque to pay cheque . 
These emergency funds could be used to cover the additional expenses incurred by manufacturers and merchants , for such things as the rental or purchase of generators , and fuel . 
For a while I am sure many of my constituents thought that the monster had actually won the battle . 
She related to me how when the military came to her small village south of Ottawa after it had been days and days without power she almost wept . 
These people are volunteers who every day and every week while on these firefighting crews risk their lives . 
I would also like to pay tribute to all the people throughout Quebec , in neighbouring provinces , and in the northeastern United States , who came to help out in the affected areas or who sent supplies , vital equipment , firewood , generators , and on and on . 
This was a disaster , and all the problems that can go along with one cannot be foreseen . 
Katimavik is a youth corps program bringing our youth together to work on community projects . 
Residents were taking in neighbours in the urban parts of the communities up and down the concessions . 
I was very pleased to approach the Minister of Canadian Heritage to say that the people of Maxville needed 20 flags . 
I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of my riding , Compton - Stanstead , the people who gave their knowledge , their equipment and their time to help their neighbours during the crisis . 
Businesses who deal with FORD - Q will be able to postpone the reimbursement of the contributions they received as part of the department ' s programs . 
Would it not be wonderful if we could have that attitude prevail over all times so that we do not fight among ourselves , we do not squabble among ourselves ? 
I said , my God , no way in this day and age would I be able to live like I was living 35 years ago . 
They are eager to find out about turnaround times and , more importantly , about the new moneys to be allocated to deal with the crisis . 
Mr. Speaker , I am certainly very pleased to participate in the discussion this evening on the ice storm . 
Many of these pipes are covered with ice and snow . 
In my riding of Kitchener Centre help was focused on two Quebec ridings and one in eastern Ontario . 
Michel Allen mobilized his employees and volunteers , who have been extremely helpful , at the Pierre - Charbonneau Centre , a city facility . 
Quebec produces 80 per cent of the maple syrup produced in Canada . 
They cannot watch us on their televisions .

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Some hon. members : 
I appeal to the public to inform themselves on this issue , to look at the finance minister ' s budget in detail , to look at Reform ' s plan " Securing Your Future " and to communicate their advice and their position to elected representatives . 
We will continue to adopt very prudent economic assumptions in budget making . 
We avoided that iceberg and we have done it in such a way that we were able to almost inoculate ourselves perfectly against the Asian flu . 
We are debating a resolution introduced by the official opposition to reveal what its budget priorities would be in respect to the upcoming budget . 
The bank sector alone has made profits of over $ 7 billion . 
We certainly acknowledge that the debt must be reduced. 
When we look at the taxation system in this country , we see another perfect example of how overspending and mounting debt have hurt the most vulnerable people in society . 
Security is one of the most important parts of human existence . 
We have transformed the vicious circle of higher deficits , higher interest rates and slow economic growth into a virtuous circle where lower deficits have helped produce lower interest rates , leading to higher economic growth and lower unemployment , ultimately leading to even lower deficits . 
Someone who was absolutely asleep at the wheel . 
Exhibit 13.16 on page 13 - 29 refers to provision of dental services . 
By reducing health and education transfers to the provinces . 
He dedicated it and any proceeds to a charity , Sheena ' s Place , a Toronto based non - residential centre for people with eating disorders that offers community support services and programs at no cost to users . 
Mr. Bernard Patry ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
I would like to know if the government intends to increase the former Deputy Prime Minister ' s salary , as she requested yesterday , or if it will first take measures to reduce the debt load of all students in Canada ? 
The proposed amendments are not relevant for companies established in Canada or for foreign affiliates managed abroad . 
They are the future of this country . 
It was supposed to be a tax to reduce the deficit. 
The motion is not supportable because it denies the reality of the fact that we have turned the corner . 
I wonder if the opposition is suggesting we should not fund the Canada student loans program which supports 370,000 full - time students , almost one - third of full - time students enrolled in Canadian universities this year . 
I would like them to respond to how spending this $ 45 billion on interest payments is allowing more money for these important social programs . 
The Liberals want to pursue them . 
Our government is investing in innovation and knowledge itself . 
I would like to remind the House that one of the distinctive features of our previous budgets has been our commitment to ease the tax burden of the less fortunate . 
The way to do it is to change the direction of the government . 
Yet if we look at their paycheques , some of them earn $ 20,000 , some less and some maybe more , but the amount of taxes is pathetic . 
An hon. member : 
She became their nanny and they loved her so much . 
The mothers and fathers are raising our next generation , our future Canadians . 
I must admit that I do not quite follow the logic of the Liberal Party . 
I do not know if members heard about the big depression out in the prairies but things were very bleak . 
The Plastimet story reminded every Canadian that accidents can happen . 
Mr. Peter Adams 
Mr. Jean Dub é 
The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C - 18 , an act to amend the Customs Act and the Criminal Code , as reported ( without amendment ) from the committee . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to seek consent to split my time with the hon. member for North Vancouver . 
There is a sign asking one to report to the next customs station whenever it is reached. 
He worked hard in a quiet , unassuming way . 
Our culture , unity and understanding of what it is to be Canadian are strengthened and enhanced. 
Rita Galloway , the president of the first nations coalition for accountability , says this kind of thing happens all the time . 
I wonder if the federal government could ask the provincial government to at least make interest refunds eligible . 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , also in response to a member ' s request , I would like to table a letter . 
It is possible he may not because that crucial evidence has now been effectively ruled inadmissible . 
Some time in the future I will bring the following incident to the attention of the minister . 
Some hon. members : 
( 2 ) On any day on which one or more recorded divisions have taken place , the names of the Members so entered shall be printed in the Debates and the Journals , immediately following the entry for each of the said divisions . 
We are looking at electronic voting and all sorts of things that would modernize our system . 
Still , I cannot believe that members from other parties can possibly think that to vote under an absentee proxy system would enable them to do a better job and to better serve democracy . 
The Speaker 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
Mr. Peter Adams 
Ms. Louise Hardy 
How can Justice Estey expect to have open , honest , transparent dialogue when the Canadian Wheat Board is taking the same people to a quasi - judicial court and asking for millions of millions of dollars ? 
The branch lines are there . 
Obviously , grain production and the marketing of such is a key sector of the prairie economy . 
I am just wondering whether this is recorded and will be taken into account when the bill is dealt with later . 
Dictatorship works when government dictates to the constituents what they have to do and how they will do it . 
As long as this wheat board and all its operation does not fall under the long arm of the auditor general , that suspicion is going to continue . 
They were chanting " Goodale must go '' . 
This past summer I had the opportunity to talk to the mayor and council of Churchill . 
It is the transportation cost after delivery . 
I am glad that you have ruled it is not . 
Mr. John Harvard ( Charleswood - Assiniboine , Lib . ) : 
Only the provinces are in a position to use this money - 
That is a very good position . 
I asked for a debate tonight and he does not want one . 
Mr. Speaker , the member ' s question is similar to proposals made by the Reform Party and the Conservative Party a few years ago . 
Third , I am concerned that it may have come from my department and therefore I have demanded an investigation to be done . 
He was promoted in 1979 to Clerk of the House , thus becoming my boss .

CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
A fully elected board of directors is mandatory if the voice of farmers is to be truly heard . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not know if you know very much about farming , but I do know that you have a lot of knowledge about grains and what you can do with grains . 
This is what I find absolutely appalling . 
Incumbents are appointed to prestigious positions that are usually paid more than an MP , and this frees up the seat . 
All the power rests with the minister in the final analysis . 
They are sitting over there , disrespectful . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Denis Coderre : 
Mr. Jim Pankiw : 
He talked about people acting disgracefully in this House . 
7 . ( 1 ) Subject to the regulations , the Corporation shall sell and dispose of grain acquired by it pursuant its operations under this Act for such prices as it considers reasonable in order to fulfil its object set out in section 5 . 
One of them is Motion No. 21 . 
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner : 
The denial of access to so - called presidential sites is just the latest example . 
( 5 ) It is important at the outset of these types of things to be clear on why one is doing what one is doing . 
Let us not forget that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have already died. 
However , it must be clear to all countries involved what the objectives of a military strike in Iraq are and what the strike will accomplish . 
These are difficult decisions . 
That is the kind of person we are talking about . 
We cannot walk away . 
The problem we now encounter with Iraq could one day arise with the growing powers of developing countries . 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
Does the government have the guts and the courage to work for a peaceful solution ? 
It is easy to say . 
Since February 1 , we have asked to meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs - a meeting that was held on Sunday , February 1 - with the Minister of National Defence , and with the Prime Minister . 
If they are that much of a threat in Iraq , what are we going to do about the threat they pose across the world ? 
That is important . 
By acting now we can save possibly millions of innocent lives down the road . 
These are forces that may play a significant role in the present situation . 
On occasion , critics question the role of members of Parliament , suggesting that they do little to earn their remuneration . 
There still remains a chance that a diplomatic solution can be reached. 
Canada is recognized around the world as a peaceful country , which sends out troops to maintain peace . 
Who better than Canada to defend world peace . 
In 1991 , as a part of the United Nations contingent , Canadian troops provided logistic support in the gulf war against Iraq and Saddam Hussein . 
One of the things the government could have been doing over the last several years is working to strengthen the UN . 
Would it be worse to deal militarily with some of the collateral damage , men and women who will be hurt by this , men and women who Saddam Hussein puts in front of his military establishments as shields against attack , or would it be better to let him go on as he did in the 1980 s with the Kurdish people ? 
World leaders in the past have drawn parallels between Saddam Hussein and other great figures of political and moral evil of the century like Adolf Hitler . 
Ms. Alton is utterly opposed to any military action . 
We face the certainty of harm and destruction if we join the U.S. in bombing Iraqi citizens because those are the people who will suffer . 
IRAQ 
Hon. Allan Rock 
The hon. member alleged that both bills were essentially the same . 
SUPPLY 
That is quite easy to understand . 
Mr. Speaker , I answered all those questions yesterday and the day before . 
We are not going to make important decisions without that information . 
I did not think there was any dispute about this . 
We have brought forward a number of ideas to help move the debate along . 
We have moved from one constitutional failure to another . 
Mr. Speaker , as the member for Jonqui è re , who was democratically elected June 2 to represent the constituents of my riding in the House of Commons , I wish to support the motion introduced by the member for Laurier - Sainte - Marie , the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , concerning the future of the Quebec people , and to repeat my conviction that Quebeckers alone have the right to decide their future , and that the current reference to the Supreme Court on the sovereignty of Quebec is contrary to our democratic values . 
The list of the irresponsible comments by the secessionists is very long , but I do not have the time to speak to that . 
The debate has , of course , become particularly lively in the past few decades , but the consolidation of national unity is an ongoing task . 
My deeply held belief is that the Quebec people exists , that it has the right to have a country of its own and to run it in its own way , being respectful of international conventions and of its immediate neighbours and of countries that are a little bit more remote . 
The economist intelligence unit of London predicts that we will have the third best business environment in the world over the next five years . 
There is in Quebec a consensus that this reference is pointless , illegitimate and disrespectful of our democratic values . 
No. 
There will be a frigate and Hercules airplanes going there . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
* * * 
To them they do not exist . 
There are Indian groups and municipalities that have said that regardless of Quebec ' s secession , they want to remain a part of Canada . 
It is very clear that he did not mean an unilateral declaration when he recognized the need for an agreement with the other partner . 
The fact that we are a united country gives us more economic weight . 
We in the Bloc are always moved when we discuss this issue with our colleagues opposite . 
To do so , one must recognize and agree that this offer of partnership made after achieving sovereignty may provide the basis for settling disputes . 
While it is true that unilateral secession has no basis in law , it would raise problems that are even more difficult to overcome , as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs indicated in his letter to Mr. Ryan . 
The decision made by the Chair is being challenged. 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
The use of more reliable U.S. west coast ports would result in the loss of cargo and British Columbia jobs in the ports . 
Before long the collective action taken by the women began to have the desired effect . 
Some of the neighbours are inconvenienced because they will have to go to a different store . 
Some international economists have warned that the recent crisis in the Asian markets could have a negative impact on foreign companies doing business there . 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
Mr. Ren é Canuel ( Matap é dia - Matane , BQ ) : 
We should all be delighted at this marriage , because it will provide a significant boost to the economy of the Montreal region . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister might recall that he offered the same level of compensation as for Alberta in a letter he himself sent to Minister Brassard . 
Mr. Speaker , the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister are singing from very different song sheets . 
Is the crew properly trained in chemical and biological countermeasures ? 
CN Rail has caught the merger mania with its decision to take over Illinois Central. 
I will keep the House advised of all further developments in this matter . 
It amended six different federal laws , the Criminal Code , the National Transportation Act , the Canada Elections Act , the Citizenship Act , the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act , all with a view to improving the situation of Canadians with disabilities . 
The chairperson , the vice - chairperson and at least two other members of the tribunal would be required to have certain legal qualifications . 
I should point out that this bill , S - 5 , is absolutely identical to Bill C - 98 , which the former Minister of Justice now Minister of Health tabled at the end of the last Parliament . 
The process at the present time is driven by an individual complaint system and that is problematic . 
I ask the question why . 
However , of course , it is an established part of our constitutional framework . 
It did not end there . 
Once installed on the other side of the House , the Liberals decided that not all lobbying was a bad thing . 
It is done by the use of the biggest equipment known to mankind , so there are not a lot of jobs . 
Did the government wait 14 years to pay $ 474 million in cancellation fees to get out of the EH - 101 helicopter deal ? 
Mr. Dick Harris 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew 
HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Some hon. members : 
Will those crops be included ? 
The minister responsible for the wheat board has been able to achieve the almost impossible . 
We have to have control over a product like this . 
( 2 ) The Corporation shall establish , annually , the portion of each producer ' s wheat which each individual producer will be allowed to hedge under this program . 
Please , if there is one thing I can plead with the government and with the Canadian Wheat Board , it is put into place now what is necessary for the next year , two years or three years to make choices and options available . 
It is not rubbish . 
The bill currently provides that the already existing advisory committee may - it may , but all this is not clear - continue to exist . 
The member from the Reform Party is geographically challenged. 
Motion No. 46 
Who is it who wants barley out from the wheat board jurisdiction in the inclusion clause ? 
They are classifying wheat board supporters . 
This week the Department of Citizenship and Immigration will be recognizing Elizabeth Saveta Milojevic , a constituent in my riding , for her outstanding work in providing assistance to refugees on their arrival in Canada . 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , it has now been 16 years since the 1982 Constitution was unilaterally imposed against Quebec ' s wishes . 
He made sure that the specific clause in the omnibus bill would be under the responsibility of the secretary of state , as is still the case . 
Mr. Speaker , if I may correct the record , I was in New York and not in the Arab countries . 
Representatives of the three unions for the asbestos workers of Thetford Mines and Asbestos have just learned of the federal government ' s intention to pursue diplomatic exchanges with France instead of immediately filing a complaint with the WTO . 
These are the same producers that came forward and said emphatically that they did not want to be part of the board with this particular commodity . 
I asked and requested it to be responsive to the farmers in my riding . 
It is clear the government has been consistently wrong on how to best address the needs of Canadian wheat farmers , and this bill is no exception . 
They conclude in their study : " The results show that Canadian Wheat Board marketing averaged an increase to the wheat pool account of $ 13.35 per tonne , or $ 265 million per year for the 14 year period over what would have been realized by multiple sellers '' . 
Certainly in terms of a marketing organization for grain , you do not need to have everybody within one board . 
The recommendations that deal with the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board that came from the Western Grain Marketing Panel are all contained in Bill C - 4 . 
That is what was said by Liberals and today we have closure on this bill . 
The farmer must opt out for a minimum of fives years and give two years notice of opting back in . 
All through the last parliament we had closure , closure , closure . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
More specifically , the bill states that a person who with intent to deny a right of access under this act destroys or alters a record , or falsifies a record or makes a false entry in a record or does not keep required records is guilty of an indictable offence and may be imprisoned for up to five years or fined up to $ 10,000 or both . 
It is very important that the public has access . 
That is a correct policy . 
Anyway , back to Bill C - 208 . 
In fact , the job training that was done was not linked to any realistic employment opportunities . 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau 
INCOME TAX ACT 
Mr. Mac Harb 
What I want to do this morning very briefly is put some information into the House and hopefully put some parameters on the debate we are having today . 
In a country such as Canada that has tremendous wealth and resources this is something we simply cannot tolerate . 
One of our major concerns has been low income working families . 
That concerns us very deeply because it is their future we need to be looking after . 
We have great expectations . 
Mr. Speaker , if the finance minister is ever going to realize his dream of becoming the prime minister , he must make sure he is a household name . 
We recognize that youth unemployment is an issue . 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
His name is Stephen Gaon . 
* * * 
Mr. Mac Harb ( Ottawa Centre , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 325 , an act to establish national standards across Canada for education provided by the provinces . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
It is all very well to support " zero tolerance " of poverty , but what strikes me as essential are the concrete actions that must be taken to improve the situation of the most disadvantaged. 
The average American is now 25 % richer than the average Canadian . 
If the country were not as wealthy as it is , we could perhaps say our hands are tied and there is not much we can do . 
Mr. Speaker , I do not think the NDP has ever shirked from coming up with an alternative approach . 
Many of the SMEs are learning that by being more flexible and being able to use the Internet they are actually getting into more business and more exports . 
Riel recruited and organized a company of armed horsemen to defend the borders . 
I have seen tears of gratitude and hope well up in their eyes when for the first time they say " I am a Canadian '' . 
The member for Rimouski - Mitis has raised two issues . 
With that in mind I will spend a few minutes talking about what the federal government is doing today to advance the interests of Metis and off reserve aboriginal people . 
Mr. Jim Pankiw 
Mr. Steve Mahoney 
Mr. John Herron 
This information was supplied to the European Union by the Plant Health Committee of Canada . 
If we are to succeed as a nation with all of our forest products we will have to fight to ensure that trade barriers are eliminated and that Canada ' s interests are first and foremost . 
That was the reasoning behind European plant protection measures asking to identify bore holes in the wood . 
Consider the facts . 
Since 1994 the Liberals have known that there were problems with the SBLA and yet here we are , four years later , receiving a report like this from the auditor general. 
What did the auditor general recommend further ? 
We also know that their ability to create jobs in this economy is unsurpassed by any other sector of the economy . 
As the auditor general pointed out , small businesses play a very significant role in the economy . 
Without that program certain firms would not have the access to capital they currently have under this program . 
Mr. Speaker , when was Premier Bouchard ' s last speech on the importance of education for Quebec ? 
Some day a new Senate will be the big story 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
That is the process we followed in this case and we will continue to follow it . 
* * * 
Now other communities appear to be subject to this ASD flu as well . 
The payroll deduction tables were placed on the website in December as a public service to employers who need this vital information in order to prepare their payroll systems for the year that began January 1 , 1998 . 
I think the SBLA program is an efficient , effective program to help start - up companies , to help young companies and expanding companies to expand . 
For seven years I worked with the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , an organization largely supported by small business . 
Is it okay for foreign banking competition to come into the country carte blanche ? 
Another thing really bothers me . 
In my riding I have talked to small business people and they have told me about the difficulty they have in attracting capital. 
Look at the employment insurance provisions and the taxes there . 
As the Bloc members at the time pointed out - and the member for Trois - Rivi è res spoke to me of it , I recall , he reminded me of it just before I rose to speak - the program is too limited , however . 
Some have called it a subsidy to business . 
The Small Business Loans Act program is not a subsidy to business . 
Mr. Jim Pankiw : 
Mr. Speaker , the member has just spoken in favour of this bill and in favour of increasing the potential taxpayer liability of this bill . 
While some women entrepreneurs may have businesses around the $ 500,000 gross revenue mark they still provide employment . 
The statistics indicate that the system is working well . 
NAYS 
Division No. 78 
Mr. Andr é Harvey : 
Mr. Speaker , the official opposition will vote no to this motion . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Hon. St é phane Dion 
Mr. Larry McCormick 
It safeguards our grain marketing strengths . 
As a matter of fairness and balance , just as there is an exclusion clause , there will also be an inclusion clause in the new law . 
Currently there are 59 members in the Reform Party caucus . 
It called for a removal of feed barley export sales from the board monopoly as soon as possible . 
I am sure other members later in this debate will talk about that issue . 
More than two years ago now , we in this House began to look at a certain bill , Bill C - 72 , which died on the Order Paper because the government decided to call an early election . 
As a then new member of this Chamber , I was optimistic that we would be able to , in a collegial committee atmosphere , make improvements to the bill . 
The Canadian Wheat Board is a far more open process and is far more open to scrutiny than the corporations that bankroll the Reform Party or the coalition against Bill C - 4 . 
I say that to my colleagues on the Liberal benches and plead with them not to stop the ongoing debate that is happening currently with Bill C - 4 . 
It could have explained to us what is good and what is bad about that organization so we could try to implement the good into the Canadian Wheat Board . 
This is one of those cases . 
Of course it comes under attack by our trading competitors . 
He went to the law books and he started studying law . 
It prosecutes one farmer and throws him into shackles and it gives another farmer $ 250,000 in bonuses for selling outside the pooling system . 
It is happening in this country . 
Order , please . 
Subject to the approval of the new board of directors , which will be a majority of farmers and producers , the Canadian Wheat Board would be able to make cash purchases of wheat and / or barley , adjust initial payments whenever market conditions warrant , close and pay out pool accounts at any time , issue negotiable producer certificates , provide an early pool cash - out option , fully use modern risk management tools , make payments to producers for their grain storage and / or carrying costs , facilitate deliveries to condo storage systems and receive grain through on farm mobile elevators . 
The people were there physically . 
Today this government is ending debate on changes to the Canadian Wheat Board by invoking closure . 
Is that their vision for Canada ? 
My question is very simple : 
NATIONAL REVENUE 
What is the minister saying in his speech ? 
QUESTION PERIOD 
It is time the Reform Party put its ideology aside . 
They would be able to examine the prices at which grain is sold , the price premiums achieved , all operating costs and whether the CWB is operating effectively . 
Bill C - 4 will also give the Canadian Wheat Board ' s board of directors the authority to use new marketing tools . 
Farmers have huge problems with the transportation system and with the heavy taxation this government imposes upon them . 
This is a sad day for western Canadian farmers . 
That is in Bill C - 4 . 
We so not say to people in eastern Canada that they cannot say anything about farm issues in the west . 
You have to tell him that he has to do the best that he thinks is right for him . 
As far as the recommittal of the bill , the hon. member for Prince George - Peace River moved : 
In fact , if there is one lesson that can be learned from the evidence heard during the committee examination of Bill C - 47 , which dealt with the new reproductive techniques in general , it is that not all techniques can be put in the same basket , and they cannot be regulated as one whole . 
Given the rapid changes in technology nothing is impossible . 
Imagine cloning in the case of the Minister of Finance . 
Mr. Joseph Volpe : 
The doors will also be open for more foreign banking into this country . 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
THE SENATE 
Mr. Gary Lunn 
Government by appointment is clearly outdated , undemocratic and unacceptable . 
Mr. Speaker , the United Nations has honoured Canada for several years by acknowledging that our country is the best country in the world . 
MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party is always looking at information that is quite old . 
* * * 
The last 10 days of fighting have produced hundreds of thousands of refugees and a serious food shortage . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on the same point of order . 
Statements by Ministers . 
Briefing on New - Zealand Refugees issues and tour of Mangere refugee resettlement centre . 
Briefing led by Mr. Des Storer , First Assistant Secretary , Australian Parliamentary , Legal and Research Division , DIMA , on Australian immigration legislative framework . 
Agreed. 
The Deputy Speaker : 
In fact , to underline just how important this motion is , I would like to take this opportunity to move the following amendment to the motion : 
Let us talk about taxation for a minute . 
What does conservative mean ? 
I will say right at the outset that the Bloc Quebecois will be supporting this motion , because we agree with its analysis . 
This would cover the cost of tuition fees for every student in this country . 
In the city of Kamloops alone , using this microcredit arm of the federal government , 850 new businesses have been created. 
In Newfoundland , fish plant closures have done away with many jobs . 
Many state governments offer very generous tax and investment incentives to businesses for the purpose of attracting investment and innovation activities . 
I would rather call it an intellectual exodus . 
It is creating jobs and opportunities in companies that make this country proud on a global basis . 
They bask in the glory of the GST. 
It does not say by how much . 
It is just smoke and mirrors . 
So they are new to this place . 
He has said " If I were in Manitoba , I would be a bit jealous of students in Quebec , because they have an excellent system of loans and bursaries '' . 
That , in the opinion of this House , the government should set targets for the elimination of poverty and unemployment , and should pursue those targets with the same zeal it has demonstrated for targets to reduce the deficit. 
No. 
We need lower taxes and less government intervention and over - regulation of businesses so that opportunities can be created. 
Those are two million Canadians who simply should not have been there in the first place . 
Division deferred 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
The Deputy Speaker : 
There is potential for an active displacement effect . 
We want to make the system very productive . 
There is nothing original in the legislation . 
The auditor general confirms that by telling us that it is a poorly run and poorly administered program . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Some hon. members : 
I therefore strongly urge this House to consider this important legislation expeditiously . 
Reform will be supporting this bill . 
We , as members of Parliament , should say we are not going to take it any more , enough is enough . 
This has tugged at my heart. 
We do not want Bill S - 4 to be reflective of an archaic , unelected , unaccountable and unrepresentative body . 
It is the least expensive mode of transportation , and the least dangerous one from an environmental point of view . 
On behalf of my constituents , I congratulate you , Nancy . 
Mr. Denis Coderre : 
So , they try to hit the Minister of Finance below the belt . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
In a letter sent a few days ago to Canadian nationals in Lebanon , Ambassador Daniel Marchand implies that they ought to be prepared to withstand a siege or to evacuate the country , because of the imminent armed conflict with Iraq . 
Mr. David Iftody ( Provencher , Lib . ) : 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
Let me assure members that I have listened to these concerns . 
Legislating the parties back to work gets the wheels moving again , but it does not do anything to resolve the issues that are still in question in the contract . 
In summary , this bill implements reforms to the industrial relations provisions of part I of the Canada Labour Code , to provide a framework for collective bargaining that enhances the ability of labour and management to better frame their own agreements and allows workplace disputes to be resolved in a timely and cost effective manner . 
Day in and day out , week in and week out , month in and month out , we endured subtle , underhanded and persistent violence . 
Even they do not like other aspects of this bill , this clause alone , the movement of grain , is of such critical importance that all parties should be getting behind Bill C - 19 to deal with it . 
Being that the member is from an agricultural province , I can be certain about one thing , he knows absolutely nothing about grain handling . 
It would also have helped the union ' s case immeasurably , which an employer should not be obligated to do . 
I would like to discuss just a few of the measures contained in this legislation which will ensure that we have such a system in place as we face the challenges of the future . 
I would argue that this is an issue of primary care that goes across health care , justice and social services . 
We are doubling the funding . 
Although the motion in large part addresses child and youth crime , I believe that the problem goes beyond the mandate of the justice system . 
Many programs already exist in centres in Canada and the U.S. There is the program in Hawaii pioneering early intervention programs for children focusing on high risk families . 
It will teach them about all the sophisticated equipment and everything necessary for working around an arena . 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
They all are an integral part of the bill which will make it work well . 
The bill recognizes that there should be some certainty in the ability of farmers to ship grain and in our fulfilling international grain contracts . 
They ship their products out to the coast . 
What can possibly be wrong with saying to a new organizing union that it must get somewhere between 35 % and 50 % of the people to join its union and sign a card before a vote is ordered ? 
Allow me to mention one name in particular , that of Arianne Matte , of Louis - Riel Public High School , in my riding of Carleton - Gloucester . 
They are worried when key spokesmen promoting the deal say that the MAI is necessary because there is a surplus of democracy in the world today which is interfering with the movement of investment and capital. 
Millions of Canadians want immediate tax relief . 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mrs. Monique Guay ( Laurentides , BQ ) : 
SchoolNet ' s digitized collections will provide 82 projects , both in French and in English . 
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) : 
Issues 
This is all caused by the intransigence of the union management . 
The rail system was a very important factor in building this nation and carrying product to port so we could participate in the international market . 
I hope all members of this House will agree that the bill deserves their support because this bill is a fair and a balanced package of amendments based on recommendations of an independent task force of labour relations experts . 
This is the government ' s second kick at the can for this legislation . 
The Prime Minister stood in the House as leader of the opposition under the Mulroney government and said " The Prime Minister of Canada always sides with the multinationals and not the sick and poor . 
We are here today debating my colleague ' s bill because many Canadians feel that the balance has shifted. 
With respect to the member for Haldimand - Norfolk - Brant , I am glad he stood in this House and indicated there are some concerns about it , but he did not catch the words I said earlier with respect to the World Trade Organization . 
Mr. Jim Jones 
Mr. Charlie Power 
Bill S - 4 . 
The United Nations responded to some of the atrocities during the second world war and to some of the other issues I brought forward by drafting the United Nations declaration of human rights . 
There is no debate in Canadian society , I would hope , and there is certainly none in Quebec society . 
It so sorely does not understand the whole idea of private property . 
People who heard about the negotiations were concerned and they raised the issue during the election campaign . 
We saw what happened in British Columbia when the NDP government was in power from 1991 . 
I cannot understand it . 
It is important that the government let Canadians know and it is in the process of doing that with respect to the full impacts the agreement will have on certain sectors . 
Eliminating protectionist barriers and opening up our borders to international competition will enable our businesses to increase their foreign business opportunities , we are told . 
As soon as we got back here , what political party was up in the House of Commons asking to hear more about the MAI , asking for public hearings and an emergency debate in the House of Commons ? 
When I speak with the member for Saint John she tells me how Saint John has benefited from free trade . 
Do we see this in the red book ? 
We are on the eve of this year ' s budget . 
Funding for post - secondary education must remain a partnership which includes the federal and provincial governments , parents , businesses , alumni and students . 
Over the past several months I have listened to my Reform colleagues make unfounded accusations and untrue statements about various staff members . 
Hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Since a diplomatic solution has now been reached , negotiated by none other than the Secretary General of the United Nations , does the minister intend to promote this approach among his partners , including the United States ? 
Hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
Also the public mourns the loss of police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty and wish to support in a tangible way the surviving families in their time of need. 
This is just an example again of how poorly they communicate with the constituency . 
If the Reformers do not understand our explanation for participating in the negotiations , why are they supporting that participation ? 
He pathetically stood in his place to tell us that he got better treatment in the United States of America than he could have in Canada . 
For the purposes of Canadian culture either of the two options is the same . 
This seems to aid the United States position on that which is that they would oppose very broad cultural exemptions . 
These people have no knowledge of what is going on around the table . 
The member asks why there was no mention . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for his very important and relevant question . 
Mr. Jim Abbott : 
Earlier the member for Kootenay - Columbia indicated that the government , if I understood him correctly , was pitting one industry against another industry . 
I believe the minister is in the process of negotiating that form of cultural protection . 
As was pointed out , the agreement is essentially still under negotiation among the parties to the round table , and , as I mentioned earlier , under the aegis of the OECD . 
It being 6.15 p.m. , it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question necessary to dispose of the business of supply . 
Mr. Speaker , on behalf of the small business people in York South - Weston I will be voting with the government on this motion . 
The lack of affordable child care is a particular concern because the benefit is structured to push low income mothers into the workforce without providing funding for quality child care options . 
As a result Canadian fishermen became desperate , backed into a corner by Alaskan overfishing and disastrous federal fishing policies that have left many almost bankrupt . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
These stoppages in our transportation system have very serious ramifications for our reputation on the international stage as a reliable shipper of farm commodities . 
The hon. member wondered if I would like to comment . 
When all the countries in the world are moving away from this whole concept of forced unionism , forced compliance to join unions , Canada is going in the opposite direction . 
I do not know if that is an oversight by the government , but it is serious concern of the people in my riding . 
As other speakers have alluded to , employers can be forced by the board through this legislation to provide the names and addresses of off site employees to would be union organizers without the knowledge and consent of the workers . 
We are committed to their protection and that is exactly what we are trying to do . 
It can be used equally by labour and management . 
Democracy has been taken out of the union movement . 
I admit that it is a small concession , but it is a lost opportunity to do something about a major problem which we have in this country . 
He actually got 52.4 % of the vote . 
As a result it creates a whole lot more abuse when the two of them are coupled. 
Both parties will come to the table with a package that is very close to reasonable because obviously if they are at an impasse , they will want their package to be selected. 
Anyone who thinks that having his or her name on a little list is not a threat to a worker should look back a few weeks to the attempt in British Columbia at recall where everyone who signed a recall petition had to provide his name and address . 
We use the Privacy Act to protect crooks and thieves . 
There is absolutely no accountability whatsoever . 
This is related to the flesh eating disease , with no known cause and no cure . 
Millions of Canadians share this youngster ' s anguish . 
Financial assistance to students has been a shared responsibility for a very long time now , and many of us here in the House have benefited from it . 
The government need not take any lessons from the Reform Party on taxes . 
Mr. Speaker , as has been said often by members on this side of the House , it is because of the hard work and the support of Canadians that we have been able to accomplish the successes we have had as a government . 
In his very first budget , the Minister of Finance stated that payroll taxes were a barrier to employment . 
The House can take care of itself , I believe . 
This kind of law is very dangerous . 
I found that in my work as academic president when we made arrangements to have a dispute resolution mechanism , with time lines and arbitration , everything worked out a lot better . 
This legislation does nothing to stop strikes . 
In the last little while the speakers have all been from the Reform Party . 
What do we have here ? 
That is why this budget provides resources for the national AIDS strategy . 
The scholarships will average $ 3,000 each per year . 
The youth unemployment problem remains grave in this country . 
And today , for 13 middle - income million Canadians , we are eliminating the surtax . 
Ms. Libby Davies 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
* * * 
Today I heard from a woman in Regina who was forced into bankruptcy largely due to cuts in education funding . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday in his speech , the Minister of Finance read the press release that followed the premiers ' meeting in December . 
In fact , in this year ' s budget the government spent the entire contingency fund on new spending and the whole debt repayment program is premised on the contingency fund going to debt . 
ARMENIA 
What constituency is the hon. member talking about ? 
The petitioners from the city of Kamloops and surrounding communities are concerned about the government ' s decision to pursue the multilateral agreement on investment and are against the MAI on principle . 
When the Liberals took office the deficit , the legacy of fiscal mismanagement left over from the Tories , stood at $ 42 billion . 
Let me turn for a minute to taxation . 
I meet lots of them : the university graduate who is working in the fast food joint , the engineering graduate who is driving a cab . 
The federal government , through its finance minister , also kept us from seeing the real extent of its leeway . 
What I really cannot sit still for is the Minister of Finance parading around telling anyone who will listen that it was his doing . 
I was very moved by the words of the hon. leader of the NDP , especially when mentioned the young woman in New Brunswick . 
Surely he must have sounded a little funny because the Liberal minister of finance in New Brunswick actually denounced the budget . 
He suggested that the minister should have a red face . 
Canada ' s pace of economic growth and job growth is positioning us as a world leader among the major industrial nations . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
The first point is that the millennium scholarship fund will focus spending on about 6 % of the students , leaving 94 % of the students out there still looking for a way to get to university . 
We think it is time to devote an equal balance between debt reduction and tax relief to help Canadians secure their futures and to give them the real hope that only the Reform Party can truly give them . 
In 1993 it had promised a summit on the future of marine construction in Canada . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
Miss Deborah Grey 
Ms. Jean Augustine 
It is an interesting and total across the board expression of opinion in British Columbia without any demand for quid pro quos or reasoning arguments in return . 
In the case of my province of Ontario , the Canada health and social transfer was reduced by an amount equal to about 2.5 % of Ontario ' s revenues or $ 1.2 billion less than they received the year we took office . 
Let us take a look at how the zero deficit was achieved. 
Congratulations to the government for following up on our suggestion . 
I believe it is very , very important that the deficit has been eliminated. 
A message from His Excellency the Governor General transmitting estimates for the financial year ending March 31 , 1999 was presented by the President of the Treasury Board and read by the Speaker to the House . 
All told , the Minister of Transport has chosen to ignore 11,241 people . 
He chose not to support health care . 
Home care has been jettisoned. 
One is the student side and the other is the educational infrastructure side . 
The hon. member may think that I did not read the budget , but I did. 
Madam Speaker , I would like to ask the hon. member a question on the government ' s debt reduction policy . 
Mr. Speaker , there seems to be some confusion . 
The member mentioned transfer payments . 
This budget is visionary . 
For instance , when a dairy cow ' s production is used for industrial milk , the federal minister has jurisdiction . 
I am going to talk about government fables . 
A short response . 
This government took a responsible balanced approach . 
It is the government that is hammering the Canadian taxpayer . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
The member mentioned that she thought that the $ 25 million for the Canadian Unity Information Office was simply propaganda . 
* * * 
In the first balanced budget in nearly three decades the minister did what ? 
Oh , oh . 
I think we will try somebody else . 
What is the minister ' s position on preserving our rights to promote and protect Canadian culture during these negotiations ? 
Hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
I will hear his point of order , after I have heard the questions of privilege of which I have notice at this point. 
He will not get a foundation until this House grants one . 
For instance , this evening we are finishing earlier to accommodate colleagues who are not of my political persuasion . 
Then it is not properly represented , Mr. Speaker . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
A strong economy that is well managed is needed so that Canadians can compete in the global economy . 
They started it and look where we are today . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi 
Mrs. Pauline Picard 
Introduction and first reading 
A whopping 6 % of all the students are going to see one dime of that money . 
They need her at home right now . 
If young people can do anything to insulate themselves from joining the unemployed , the data paints a pervasive picture that the answer can be summed up in one phrase : stay in school . 
We needed to help low income families , especially low income families with children . 
We are the ones who inherited a $ 42 billion deficit. 
At the same time , this being zero help to the poor seniors , the benefit discriminates against the middle income and upper income seniors by taxing back up to 75 % of their personal retirement savings that they have sacrificed and put away so they can be secure in their retirement . 
They go to schools which are famous for drugs , gangs and crime . 
I say so because Canada has such diversity that regional development instruments are required and regional agencies are a way for us to make national programs tailor made for regional needs. 
It will have a huge impact on students . 
Quebec spends $ 600 million on a program designed to provide loans and scholarships to 170,000 students . 
All the provincial ministers of finance and education acknowledge that in Quebec we have the best system of student loans and grants . 
To me , families are the highest priority we have . 
Fix the Young Offenders Act . 
They approved of the government ' s plan to put the national debt on a permanent downward track , to provide tax relief for 14 million Canadians and to make wise investments in key priority areas such as health care , education , youth employment , technology and research and development . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to begin by pointing out that the number of welfare recipients in Quebec is the lowest it has been in four years . 
Mr. Speaker , my supplementary question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
Let us do it the Canadian way by making sure that everyone will participate . 
Her husband had to leave work in order to care for her because she was too ill to work . 
The material that is before you in this article touches upon your high office . 
I submit , Mr. Speaker , that you should be subject to it from time to time as well , if MPs so choose to make these comments . 
Mr. St é phane Bergeron ( Verch è res , BQ ) : 
It is absolutely unconscionable that we could possibly be voting in favour of a motion to turn this over to procedure and House affairs . 
That is still awaiting your decision , Mr. Speaker , although some of my friends think this might be the point and place for that debate . 
Then perhaps it will be sent to committee where it will languish away , festering and burbling away in the back rooms of this place instead of being dealt with quickly and succinctly as it should have been all along . 
We travelled from coast to coast and placed special emphasis on western Canada . 
* * * 
These petitioners pray that Parliament will review the mandate of the CRTC and direct the commission to administer a new policy which will permit and encourage the licensing of religious broadcasters to end this mark on freedom of expression in Canada . 
Indeed , I spent many years wondering how it was possible that Canada can continue to go so close to the abyss of financial ruin . 
I want to tell the members of this House that having been in my riding , like many other members , for the past week and speaking with many of my constituents , this budget has been a huge disappointment . 
That is something the federal government should be following and working to implement with other provinces . 
At the present time we have no negotiators acting on Canada ' s behalf . 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
Mrs. Pauline Picard 
( Division 97 ) 
While there she publicly complained that there were too many Canadian flags on display . 
On this topic , I have one last point. 
I was very upset and hurt on February 26 , 1998 when all members waved Canada ' s flag around like five - year - olds during a royal visit and sang the national anthem in the House . 
But Canadians are not going to reap the benefits . 
This is unfortunate . 
These increases are absolutely essential in maintaining the progress we have made in the health of northern peoples . 
Provincial expenditures are increased because of the welfare burden , yet their transfer payment revenue from Ottawa is cut . 
These scholarships will swallow up money that should have been put towards improving the school system , and they will contribute to the further deterioration of relations , if they can possible get any worse , between Quebec City and Ottawa . 
This measure addresses concerns residents of Guelph - Wellington had with the inequity that allowed owner - managers to receive tax exempt private coverage , but not the self - employed. 
This is of benefit to our scientists and students and it is good news for all Canadians , for the fruits of the labours of our researchers will certainly spill over for the benefit of all Canadians . 
I see those two things as cross purposes . 
It will be even worse for future generations if we don ' t face reality and deal with this debt . 
We have broadened the eligibility for the child care expense deduction to assist parents who undertake education or retraining . 
We also see the concept of money being offered in terms of tax breaks to those who volunteer as firefighters and members of local fire departments . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his hard work on the finance committee as well as for his work in his constituency on prebudget consultations . 
We need to pay the highest respect to our forces . 
Such reports destroy the sovereignist myth that the Canadian economy - 
Mr. Speaker , had the hon. member attended the conference she would have seen , as I did , that 400 knowledgeable people from across the country who know the subject agreed that the important thing to do is to plan wisely and invest carefully if we are going to solve the problem . 
The Prime Minister received recognition for the work and the progress we have made as far as disabled people in Canada are concerned. 
Mr. Speaker , does the Minister of Human Resources Development not realize that human beings are suffering , that children are going hungry ? 
In all the years that I have been in this Chamber I have not yet witnessed what I saw occur here today in terms of asking questions , not only referring to the Speaker as " a prominent Liberal MP " but also to ask directly in a subsequent question about what Mr. Speaker as a person said outside of this Chamber . 
I want to say that none of the precedents cited by the Reform whip in any way suggest that the Speaker of the House is ever the voice of the government . 
Some of these new leading - edge businesses are spinoffs from the work of the NRC , NSERC and our other agencies . 
I hope Canadians were not looking for a big break on taxes in the budget , because they got none . 
Providing Manitobans with the best health care possible has always been and continues to be our top program priority . 
I would think that hiring a few biologists and allowing them to do their jobs and allowing local fishermen to develop new fisheries would strengthen a community . 
Nothing . 
I should make some other points on tax relief in part because of members opposite who are trying to leave the illusion that there is no tax relief . 
They will mean that 400,000 low income Canadians will no longer have to pay taxes . 
There also has to be clear federal - provincial guidelines . 
We have a situation where we have consumed $ 583 billion that we did not pay for . 
I think we need to look at them carefully but cautiously . 
The question is on the motion . 
THE ECONOMY 
Beware Canadian families . 
It is a short term and shortsighted strategy that ignores the demands of the various stakeholders . 
I could spend a couple of hours listing all of the tax increases the present government has slipped in . 
As well , the budget also makes available increased funding for more than $ 400 million over three years for science research granting councils : the medical research council , the national science and engineering research council and the social science and humanities research council : $ 120 million in 1998 - 99 , $ 135 million in 1999 - 2000 and $ 150 million in 2000 - 2001 , providing invaluable service to Canada . 
The provinces contribute to the national debt . 
Yet , in the case of the employment insurance surplus , the government could have said " Some regions are in a more difficult situation as regards employment . 
We see the consequences of these policies in our health system , our education system , in UI benefits that are no longer available , in housing that is no longer there and in the total loss of a whole generation of young Canadians . 
There has been a lot of debate on whether lowering job killing payroll taxes will actually have a jolt in terms of job creation . 
The federal Liberals were excruciatingly slow to get this country to the balanced budget situation , and in hindsight the numbers reveal that the most prudent course would have been a balance last year after the debacle of the Conservatives . 
This is clear cut evidence that the Bloc and Mr. Bouchard are seriously out of touch with their constituents , as are other premiers of this country . 
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 
HEALTH 
Mr. Roger Gallaway 
They are political buddies . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very proud that because of the good management of this government and the Minister of Finance , we were able to take $ 2.5 billion and put it aside to make sure that the millennium project will mean scholarships for 100,000 Canadians over 10 years . 
The hon. member for Saint John . 
We are taking very tough and very direct action . 
Today marks an important milestone in the history of Canada . 
Some hon. members : 
The petitioners note that public mourns the loss of police officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty and wish to support in a tangible way the surviving families in their time of need. 
While Reform supports increased power for the Yukon government , the powers held by the territory should not exceed those held by the provinces . 
We will take care of you '' . 
I would like to salute the 14 First Nations of Yukon , and I hope they will be the first to benefit from Bill C - 8 . 
Currently all oil and gas management authority in Yukon is controlled by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development in its energy policy area for the territories . 
An information package on the proposed resource management regime was widely distributed across the Mackenzie Valley . 
A supreme example of patronage in this country is the Senate . 
Unfortunately , there are some regions not covered by agreements on which this will now be imposed. 
It is not a radical idea . 
It is necessary because there is a monopoly under the existing broadcast rules and communications rules . 
Some hon. members : 
I want to give the hon. member who is asking the question my interpretation of the facts as I see them in an answer that he surely will respect . 
They now stand at $ 5.90 , or 40 cents more . 
HEPATITIS C 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard 
Mr. Roy Cullen ( Etobicoke North , Lib . ) : 
Similarly , on February 25 , in speaking about these scholarships , the leader of the opposition said he would have preferred to see the jurisdictions of Quebec and the other provinces respected fully . 
Why would the federal government want to gauge the readiness of our children to enter the school system if it is not to intervene in some way at some time in the future ? 
If the federal government had not used its spending power , there never would have been a national health system . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
However , I do understand this . 
Why do we have jobs unfilled and people unemployed ? 
I can tell the House that his latest whim will be written up something like this : 
I would be remiss if I did not deal today with a problem that is getting bigger and bigger in this country that is desperately looking for its own identity . 
Mr. Denis Coderre : 
Manpower training should meet our needs. 
Will millennium scholarships reduce the suicide rate in our secondary schools ? 
In conclusion , and this may be the most important message today , on this issue , the Bloc is speaking on behalf of all Quebecers . 
Later on , another individual responded to him , and that ended this special edition of a Quebec magazine called Cit é libre . 
The member is right that the imperatives are now world standards in medicine , engineering , science and languages . 
To censure such an initiative is to censure our government for putting people ' s future ahead of the Bloc ' s political grandstanding .

There has been a dramatic change in the employment portrait in Quebec for many reasons .

In a review of this issue , let me assure the hon. member and all members of this House that the question of jobs will be of paramount concern to us when we talk to the companies . 
Will the Minister of Finance state now that he will introduce and implement a tax neutral initiative to encourage small and medium size enterprises to act immediately ? 
That at the conclusion of any debate on any government legislation during government orders this day , a recorded division be deemed requested and deemed deferred to Tuesday , March 17 , 1998 , at the conclusion of government orders .

Ms. Louise Hardy : 
The CBC is expected to operate as a public broadcaster , not a state broadcaster . 
It is important to note that this right is already afforded to them in other jurisdictions . 
They range in size from small appropriation dependent corporations with limited commercial revenue to large commercial operations that operate on a self - sustaining basis . 
As NDP members said , even as much as it galls them to support something Reform came out with , they have to admit this is a good bill .

Bill C - 378 . 
It is for that reason that I would ask members of this House that when this is voted on to vote against it and defeat it . 
We are asking to keep our young children healthy . 
Ms. Elinor Caplan ( Thornhill , Lib . ) : 
Immediate tests showed no scientific evidence of DEHP in the rings . 
What we ought to do is look at a fair , open and transparent regime for regulating labour unions . 
There is another area of concern that is very real and serious with respect to Bill C - 19 , that of the offsite workers . 
Mr. Speaker , I am particularly glad to have this opportunity to introduce Bill C - 20 , which will modernize the Competition Act , and make one of our most important economic framework laws more suitable for the information age we live in . 
A telemarketer can get along making all kinds of claims without ever saying who he represents , what the price might be or what the reason is for the call .

I can state very clearly to the House that no U.S. official in any preclearance situation has the right to search and seizure of a Canadian citizen . 
Had that been the sum total of Alfred Hales ' parliamentary career , we would be justified in saying well done . 
Hon. Charles Caccia ( Davenport , Lib . ) : 
While the underlying intentions are laudable , there are other intentions that are of huge concern , and it is not clear that even Canada will approve , given the exceptions sought , in the field of culture , for example . 
He suggested that the Reform Party together with others were opposed to competition in the banking sector . 
Companies are obligated to notify the Competition Bureau of a proposed merger when two thresholds set out in the Competition Act are met . 
Two straightforward tests will provide simple criteria for defining a genuine regular price . 
The victims with whom I have met in my riding are truly the honest and the innocent . 
The bill is deficient because of a deficiency that already existed in the Competition Act . 
It is a very controversial provision and I would hope there is considerable debate in committee on it . 
What has happened ? 
I know she does not side with the bankers of Bay Street , but what about the Minister of Finance ? 
We support the credit union and the co - operative movement .

PENSIONS 
Second reading 
Is that agreed ? 
The member will perhaps remember that it was this party that raised the simple business of singing " O Canada " in the Chamber . 
That is what this debate is about , should we have the right to have a flag on our desk if we want . 
The question before us today is not whether or not Canadian members of Parliament are in favour of the Canadian flag . 
If they really want change and if they want the issue to be studied , I move : 
He said : 
As a young member I hope there will not be many more like it . 
This Parliament costs over $ 1 million a day in terms of sitting days to run . 
And I bet a dollar they will be in their red and white Roots Canada jackets . 
As a result , it just sat there , this little , tiny flag , three inches by six inches , and for those who are metric , seven and a half centimetres by fifteen . 
He was representing an attitude of self - restraint which reflected the thinking of people in the two founding nations at that period . 
We were there . 
This is a constructive debate for Canada . 
Oh , oh . 
I think this is a way out . 
As has been pointed out over and over again today , we are certainly at liberty to wear a maple leaf lapel pin , one of which I am wearing today . 
If the Reform member is so patriotic about the flag , how many Reform members have a flag on their property , on their homes , hanging in front of their houses on poles or in their offices in their ridings ?

Point over there . 
She spoke of a spontaneous demonstration . 
To carry on with this nonsense is just absolutely crazy . 
An hon. member : 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer : 
I presume he also stood and waved the flag and joined in the singing of our national anthem as a way of saying to the Bloc that we love our country . 
After all the rhetoric by that member , would he be ashamed to display a small Canadian flag on his desk as he probably does on his desk in his office in Ottawa and perhaps even in his riding ? 
In the past , Canada had always distinguished itself on the international scene by its avoidance of such manifestations of bad taste . 
My question for the member concerns the comments by the member of Rimouski - Mitis .

Oh , oh . 
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I have been down to the Atlantic provinces and I had opportunities to meet with a number of chiefs in that region . 
Is the Prime Minister today denouncing Canada ' s ties with the monarchy ? 
The petitioners note that the MAI is the latest in a series of regional and global agreements which , in the name of liberalization , trade and investment , expands the powers of multinational corporations at the expense of the powers of government to intervene in the marketplace on behalf of our social , cultural , environmental and health care goals ; that the MAI is fundamentally flawed in so far as it seeks to protect the rights of investors without seeking similar protection for workers through binding core labour standards ; and that the MAI is anti - democratic in so far as it would be binding for 20 years , thus tying the hands of several parliaments and future governments . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Since 1995 , firms that benefit from the SBLA must pay fees that are designed to recover the cost of loans claims . 
We know that all taxes kill jobs but payroll taxes at the end of the day are actually more punitive than any other tax initiative . 
An hon. member : 
The Minister of Industry agreed to allow the Standing Committee on Industry and experts from the department to review the program . 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
This will allow us additional financial resources that can be used in the creation and expansion of our national parks system and our system of national historic sites . 
We have to be very prudent in the way we do that . 
He said : 
As part of its review the working group will examine the disaster financial assistance arrangements as well as eligibility criteria for disaster relief to farmers . 
I thought he explained particularly well the role of the federal government in dealing with natural disasters and how the special nature , magnitude and focus of a particular event and the nature of the farming community affected by the ice storm encouraged the federal government to move into the area of assisting part time farmers . 
What chance do they have ? 
When a mother has to leave her place of work in order to bear a child she gets a year ' s leave at 90 % salary . 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
Hon. John Manley 
Mr. Jim Hart 
These people are concerned about amendments to section 43 of the Criminal Code dealing primarily with the discipline of children . 
Ships can be reinstated too . 
In northern Quebec , around Mistassini , north of there , in Abitibi , north of Schefferville and in all the little spots where the coast guard has no jurisdiction , the government wanted to force people to pay a fee . 
As it is , U.S. shipyards have the competitive advantages that come from contracts for military vessels which effectively subsidize the overhead costs of commercial boat building . 
We support the bill . 
Their language flows pretty in its terms , in its fancy window dressing which hides the real reason why Bill C - 29 is coming into effect . 
It is also closely related to the former section 7 . ( f ) , which provides that the government may set fees for the use of the parks . 
We are standing on a slippery slope . 
I want to reassure her that its financial management practices will still be governed by the Financial Administration Act . 
Nine times out of ten I cringe when I hear of the birth of yet another bureaucratic monolith . 
Our national parks are sort of a Canadian icon that we leave for future generations . 
We will call it commercialization or we will call it a special agency '' . 
In addition , the judge advocate general will superintend the administration of military justice in the Canadian forces . 
There are a lot of people in her family who depend on work at the base . 
Students from across Canada produced brief segments of the problems of racism in Canadian society . 
They want someone who will stand up and listen , someone who will fight for them . 
That promise has been broken and the question of the hon. member is nothing more than a rude noise which does not belong in the House of Commons . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , on Monday the Minister of Finance stated that B.C. ' s woes were due to the NDP government , yet he takes credit for all the good things that are happening in the rest of Canada . 
The Speaker : 
When the House broke for question period , the hon. member for Lakeland had 15 minutes remaining in the time for his speech . 
In this case , the purpose of the bill is to make minimal changes to the summary procedure so that it can withstand any challenge under the charter , even if commanding officers are in no way impartial and independent in the legal sense defined by the supreme court in the G é n é reux case . 
I would like to take this opportunity to say that while we have been fortunate enough not to be involved in a major war for many , many years now and in fact for some decades , we do not forget the fact that many of those serving in our armed forces are serving in very troubled hot spots around the world . 
To reiterate , I think it is fair to say that the two areas of serious concern are , first , the fact that there is no protection for whistle blowers , in other words those men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces who see a serious wrongdoing , see something that simply should not take place , who do not feel free to inform others , including the public , of this problem . 
They are experts and they have something to add to this bill . 
That is something that is not done in other police complaints commissions . 
I served five years in the regular armed forces with the navy on three Canadian destroyers , the HMCS Gatineau , the HMCS Yukon and the HMCS Qu ' Appelle . 
True things were coming out . 
Bill C - 25 will require the commission to file an annual report which will be tabled in Parliament by the Minister of National Defence .

Ms. Raymonde Folco ( Laval West , Lib . ) : 
The Canadians who participated in the Spanish Civil War left their homeland for a far away country , where they were going to risk their lives , along with other volunteers from all over the world . 
The reality is the Spanish civil war was not a battle between good and evil . 
For profit companies are benefiting from government participation in joint ventures , lucrative contracts with ministries of health , outsourcing arrangements with hospitals , generous tax breaks for venture capital investors , access to medicare payments and direct grant allocations . 
SULPHUR 
Mr. Jack Ramsay 
This first came to my attention in 1994 when the then chief of defence staff , General John de Chastelain , appeared before the special joint committee reviewing Canada ' s defence policy . 
Between April 1991 and March 1997 an average of 314 public service employees per year were granted military leave with pay and an average of 20 public service employees per year were granted leave without pay . 
My colleague from Okanagan - Coquihalla , a former member of the armed forces , a man who knows what he is talking about , has put forth Bill C - 232 . 
This bill addresses it because whatever mobilization plan we have in this country , we will require trained and capable armed forces personnel and they will have to be made up partly with reservists . 
Let us hold this government to those promises . 
We should be trying to establish better relationships with our municipal colleagues and to put in place clear definitions and clear lines of authority . 
British Columbia was the only province in Canada last year to post a net loss in jobs . 
We have many examples of that . 
We can eliminate the personal income tax surcharges . 
The next day , the Deputy Prime Minister joined the Prime Minister in saying that this measure did not apply to Canada Steamship Lines . 
I would like to return to the matter raised by the hon. member for Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot . 
At least 10 nations celebrate nature ' s rebirth and renewal on this day .

Mr. Speaker , following in the steps of numerous health stakeholders , the Government of Quebec and every provincial government , supporters of the Liberal Party of Canada are now expressing concerns about the drastic cuts made in health , cuts that have literally devastated health systems across Canada . 
Instead of criticizing Mr. Fung , the Reform Party and all Canadians should praise him . 
A number of people have been trying to find a solution to the situation that has prompted this strike , so that it can end . 
For example , over 90 community futures development corporations cover virtually 100 % of non - metropolitan areas in western Canada . 
Mr. Paul Steckle ( Huron - Bruce , Lib . ) : 
Apparent . 
The hon. member for Drummond has the floor . 
They leave because we have the highest tax levels in the G - 7 . 
This goes back to the root of the confidence of people in the government . 
If she withdrew the term " evasion '' - 
Section 241 would allow shipping companies with foreign interests to benefit from tax rebates . 
I only hope that the members opposite would listen to that member so they understand in effect that what these members in the House today did was essentially to go on a political witch hunt after this minister for their political gain . 
In other words , the bill before the House means there will be more cash to uphold the principles of the Canada Health Act . 
Madam Speaker , I would like to speak very briefly to the motion introduced by one of our colleagues in the New Democratic Party . 
When people in a riding are asked what they care about and all of them come back with the same answer , we cannot help but listen . 
It is now $ 1.7 billion in a province with just over one million people . 
We do need more resources in the system . 
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
Hon. St é phane Dion 
Mr. Chuck Strahl 
However , if the contingency reserve is not needed , and in fact it has not been needed in each of the past three years , it will go directly to paying down the overall stock of debt . 
The government talks about a balanced approach . 
This means that 52 % or most of the sacrifices were made by the provinces , which are really the ones who restored the public finances to health . 
If we were able to make calculations with a pencil and a computer , it seems to me that , with the help of the hundreds of officials and experts at Finance Canada and Revenue Canada , he could have come up with figures that more accurately matched reality , but he never did. 
Not so very long ago , we heard on the news that Edmonton hospitals were having to send patients to Saskatoon because no beds were available . 
This would put them in line with other businesses . 
My home province of New Brunswick , which has invested significant dollars into information technology training schools , cannot retain the graduates it produces because it is not able to compete with the U.S. market . 
He also mentioned that I should visit his riding . 
Many of Canada ' s important industries such as agriculture are based in rural communities . 
I will turn my attention to the Bloc for a moment . 
This government announced that there was a $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion scholarship millennium fund . 
Other provinces received much higher amounts from the federal government . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien : 
Everyone knows how much I am present and I get a lot of calls and mail . 
Experience shows that effective action can and must be taken now .

If the opposition leader can see a flaw in my argument , he should point it out , but he must understand that , failing this , he is wasting the time of the House by asking totally unfounded questions . 
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) : 
Hon. Fred Mifflin ( Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary of State ( Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency ) , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Randy White ( Langley - Abbotsford , Ref. ) : 
That is absolutely not true . 
According to a Privy Council document entitled " Human Development Expansion and Social Cohesion '' , one of the major challenges facing Canada between now and the year 2005 is social cohesion and human development . 
There is absolutely no other reason . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that the member mentioned a theme for this particular budget and I know he is also very interested in other areas . 
Like every other Canadian , I am pleased that we now have the first budget in 29 years that is balanced from a fiscal point of view . 
I am interested to see whether or not Liberals across the way might have some comments or questions and whether or not they will have the courage to question the leadership of the Prime Minister who all of a sudden has changed from red to blue and is dressed in Conservative clothing . 
In all seriousness , though , there is a recognition in economics that we simply have to change the way all governments of all stripes around this world have behaved over the past 50 , 60 or 100 years . 
Mr. Tom Wappel ( Scarborough Southwest , Lib . ) : 
When the Liberals took over from the Conservatives in 1993 , the debt was $ 500 billion . 
Mr. Speaker , it was not possible , unfortunatly , to reach an agreement pursuant to Standing Orders 78 ( 1 ) and 78 ( 2 ) with respect to the proceedings at second reading of Bill C - 36 , an act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 24 , 1998 . 
The government already provides real tax assistance to many activities that would clearly qualify under the hon. member ' s motion . 
I would have expected the government ' s attitude to be more one of being willing to consider this motion , to see what can be done . 
We had specific reasons for that and it took a considerable sacrifice on our part to do it . 
They want to see this government act now and act quickly to prevent that kind of idea from gaining any ground . 
Mr. Speaker , the current oil spill preparedness and response regime was put in place by the previous government to supplement the Canadian Coast Guard ' s existing capacity to respond to a major oil spill anywhere in Canadian waters . 
Mr. Jake E . Hoeppner 
Mr. Peter Stoffer 
He cannot abate our support for Canada by writing new laws . 
Nova Scotians have again sent a message to this federal Liberal government : health care matters . 
MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIPS 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) : 
How is the Liberal government showing leadership in restoring the economy and helping B.C. in business and jobs ? 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
The current law which is being challenged in the courts denies equality to gay and lesbian people . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to table a petition from citizens from across Canada who are opposed to the multilateral agreement on investment as it is fundamentally flawed in that it seeks to protect the rights of investors without seeking similar protection for citizens ' rights and workers ' rights through labour standards or for our environment . 
However it will not be a budget that is to be remembered by Canadians as the budget that helped Canadians get ahead in life . 
I do not think the government has given up on the people of Newfoundland . 
That is what the people say we should take care of . 
First , the millennium scholarships . 
State prohibitions that would force a dreadful , painful death on a rational but incapacitated terminally ill patient are an affront to human dignity '' . 
For that reason I believe that as legislators we must never condone or legalize the deliberate unnatural taking of life . 
I think it is fundamental in this motion , and in all the debate that has taken place , that what is key is that the decision can only come from the person involved , not from anyone else . 
YEAS 
Mr. Speaker , the members of our party vote yes . 
Mr. Speaker , I think it should be clarified that the report submitted for public consultation is not a government report . 
Should we not want the absolute best judges to make rulings in our highest court ? 
Mr. Tony Valeri 
Mr. Rick Casson 
Mr. Ivan Grose ( Oshawa , Lib . ) : 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , Question No. 46 will be answered today . 
This legislation takes further action that stops bankrupt individuals from claiming a double deduction of personal tax credits , like the GST credit , in the year of bankruptcy . 
I do not begrudge it for a moment . 
We will look at the provisions concerning the principles that should guide ministers , senior officials , and chairs of commissions and public and parapublic corporations . 
Within a day , there was a reversal , a new version was different . 
I move : 
Ask the federal government which jettisoned national standards by ending direct funding for education in 1996 and it will say it is the provinces ' responsibility . 
It is partially because of the cuts to transfers but also because of the general unemployment situation . 
The hon. member talks about the CHST transfers and the fact that our party espoused a tax point solution to this issue . 
People in my riding are forced by law to charge three times the rate that Canada Post charges for the same service . 
According to the Fraser Institute the average family paid $ 27,000 in 1997 . 
As we talk about taxes , we cannot help but be drawn to the serious problems of the health care system , unemployment and the economic opportunities within our small communities . 
The year succeeded in firmly establishing Canada ' s credentials as a Pacific nation , forging stronger and more numerous human and economic links between Canada and its partners in the region . 
The minister took these recommendations straight to Canadians herself to get a firsthand account of their concerns and views . 
Why has the Prime Minister not forced the uncaring health minister to provide compensation for every single victim ? 
Miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) :

The Canadian Space Agency announced a contract to MacDonald Dettwiler of $ 225 million for an earth observation system securing 300 jobs . 
I draw the attention of hon. members to the presence in the gallery of Mr. Lorne Taylor , Minister of Science , Research and Information Technology for the Government of Alberta . 
I was also on the committee looking into the Jean - Marc Jacob question . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to thank the member from the Bloc Quebecois for his question . 
Ms. Val Meredith : 
That is an utter and complete myth . 
It is pure politics . 
I hate to see what they are doing in the area of cultural engineering . 
Canadians are fed up with being taxed to the extent that they are . 
We need to look at some of this unfunded liability coming out of general tax revenues . 
Let us look at a few statistics , which will give us an idea of what poverty means in this country . 
The twenty hour wait for a rescue plane endured by the Little Grand Rapids plane crash victims was a result of what I believe is botched decision making by search and rescue operations . 
The red tape or bureaucracy involved is such that many of those investors have found it impossible to participate . 
SHIPPING 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
This list could be expanded or reduced if the special crops industry wants this to happen . 
Since it had been immediately apparent that amendments would not be given fair consideration at committee , my Reform colleagues and I chose to table our amendments at report stage , hoping that all MPs in the House would take the time to thoroughly consider them . 
I have some other stories I would like to relate concerning this legislation . 
In response to a patsy question from one of her own colleagues , the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Status of Women showed the true colours of the Liberals when she could not even remember the name of the constituency where the byelection is being held . 
Why did they choose a hard - hearted legal route rather than extending the warm hand of compassion to those unfortunate innocent victims ? 
Mr. Mark Muise ( West Nova , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday for the second time in a year the same search and rescue Labrador helicopter had to ditch in the Strait of Georgia . 
Hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) : 
I thought , since it is Friday , we might want to wish him all the best . 
One of the points I made during my speech is that under the present way that Bill C - 26 is structured there will be no competition in providing that insurance . 
In clause 7 of the bill the government decrees that all special crops producers must pay an insurance levy on all crops sold to licensed dealers . 
This is a question and comment period . 
Mr. Speaker , those are some excellent questions from the member for Prince George - Peace River . 
Hon. Allan Rock 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
By that time the individual , for example the pedophile , would have left . 
The will of the people , police officers and many members of the House is there , but there must be a law that works and does not breach any other laws in the process . 
That is not why this party is in the House of Commons . 
Bill C - 25 clarifies the roles and responsibilities of the various players in the military justice system . 
There are all sorts of rumours going on now with regard to the land deals that will be happening and who will get a sweet deal out of the sale of the lands . 
Who will have to do this ? 
Madam Speaker , I thank my hon. friend for his question , which hits the heart of two issues . 
I see it right up front . 
We have members of the military going to food banks and collecting welfare supplements because of structural problems in the military . 
The representatives of each side would in turn nominate a third member who would be chair . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
We are supportive of Hugh Yik ' s athletic career , and we wish him the greatest possible success . 
As presented , these scholarships do not in any way meet Quebec ' s needs in the field of education . 
Here we are proceeding on a rational analysis , a basis of principle which will remain a distinction justified by the facts . 
Mr. Speaker , 2.8 million Canadians are dependent on welfare today . 
Ms. Beth Phinney ( Hamilton Mountain , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Walt Lastewka ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
I am privileged to introduce this private member ' s bill which would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act . 
First , it is important to look at Bill C - 37 in context . 
It preferred , as it often does , or to put it more accurately , always does , to play politics . 
In essence , as I see it , it is the job of the judge to weigh very carefully the competing arguments and the evidence in front of him of her and to try and best find a just result . 
If he has a problem , then the citizens of my community definitely have a problem . 
I personally have never seen such a thing . 
The commission may also engage the services of any person necessary for proper conduct of the commission begging the question just how much will this commission cost taxpayers . 
As was pointed out , it really is not . 
Those are the four things this bill provides . 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur ( Berthier - Montcalm , BQ ) : 
Competence and a continual review process has to be in place . 
It would be nice if our salaries were taken into consideration according to the exchange rate . 
They are not supposed to be having sex in jail . 
We are also co - operating with provincial and territorial governments to deliver these benefits in the best possible way . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
As part of the national child benefit system the federal government has committed to further enriching the Canada child tax benefit by $ 850 million annually . 
While the minister allocates $ 31 million a year to her program to assist publishers , the Minister of Finance pockets some $ 120 million in revenues from taxes on reading material. 
Specialist teachers have been hit especially hard . 
Mr. Speaker , today is March 31 , the end of fiscal year 1997 - 98 . 
But where is the federal government with the RCMP ? 
To give one example of the potential for abuse , there is a 20 % top - up for individuals investing in an RESP , a matching where the government will effectively provide grants to those who invest in RESPs . 
These scholarships will swallow up money that should have been put towards improving the school system , and they will contribute to the further deterioration of relations , if they can possible get any worse , between Quebec City and Ottawa . 
Nobody wants that , particularly the young people of this country . 
They have talked time and time again of the great effort they have put into addressing the budget in order to bring this new found money into the education fund . 
The fourth principle is a principle which some of my colleagues who sit across the way should listen to very carefully . 
Does it not contain very good news for the taxpayers ? 
It is the same old malarkey , the tax and spend approach . 
The government fiddled with the figures and made this expenditure appear a year before the fact , because this served its political ambitions . 
The Immigration Act requires the minister to table in this House , in October , a report on the levels expected for the following year and the actual levels for the current year . 
He was asked if he would extend a hand to the thousands of Canadians dying from hepatitis C in their blood . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , if the hon. member would look at the history of the matter he would see that the facts themselves speak clearly for distinguishing the period 1986 to 1990 . 
The Indian affairs minister looked the other way when Bruce Starlight rang the alarm bell . 
Mr. Speaker , my colleague is referring to that part of the national youth employment strategy which was referred to by the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development a few minutes ago . 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT , 1998 
Most of us say it was too little , too late . 
The problem is that if the government collects more money than it needs , then it is overtaxing Canadians . 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien ( Frontenac - M é gantic , BQ ) : 
It will assume the centre of the road . 
I would like to comment on the Manitoba budget , not because it is a perfect budget but because of the instruction it can give to the House . 
Today a litre of gasoline costs 50 to 55 cents and 24 to 26 cents of that is for taxes . 
The House will now proceed to the taking of the deferred divisions , starting with Bill C - 25 . 
If one looks at the arguments put forward by members of the government , one sees that their concerns were addressed by my colleague . 
There has been some opposition to the idea proposed in the bill . 
Here are some excerpts . 
During 1996 the amount of venture capital in Canada rose from $ 6 billion to $ 7.1 billion . 
Mr. Preston Manning 
INTERPARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION 
Mr. Speaker , each year Canadians across the country celebrate tax freedom day . 
Here we have a glowing example of the federal government ' s cynicism , pettiness and ingratitude . 
For those before 1986 we have a medicare and a health care system to look after them in their illness . 
How can the Prime Minister explain the difference between his statements in the House and the action taken by the members of his party in committee ? 
The way the minister of Indian affairs is handling the tragic shooting of Connie and Ty Jacobs confirms all our fears . 
Mr. Speaker , on February 20 , the Minister of Transport announced the planned closure of the L é vis intermodal station , renovated in 1984 at a cost of $ 3 million . 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 34 ( 1 ) , I have the honour to present to the House , in both official languages , the report of the Canadian delegation of the Canada - Europe Parliamentary Association to the meeting of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Development of the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , held in London , England , on February 23 and 24 , 1998 . 
In light of that letter and the seriousness of it , and since the RCMP commissioner ' s letter was released to us in an access to information request , we have been made aware of the fact that these misleading statistics were also introduced six times in the Alberta Court of Appeal in affidavits filed by the federal Department of Justice and interveners supporting the government ' s position in the provincial court challenge of Bill C - 68 . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
He gave Darren Ursel a conditional sentence , not one scrapping day in jail . 
This is not a ruling I am making . 
I would like - 
The real failing here is not this legislation but the fact that it has been brought forward instead of a victims bill of rights , instead of amendments to the Young Offenders Act and instead of changing the fact that conditional sentencing is still being used by some judges to release violent offenders into our communities after they have been found guilty and have served no jail time . 
We hear the rationale that there are some circumstances where that would be cruel and unusual punishment . 
There is the role of leadership to society . 
It is unfortunate , is it not , that a private member has to be introducing this important and urgent initiative when in fact the government should be making it one of its highest legislative priorities ? 
Canadians have clearly shown us during the consultations following the royal commission ' s report that there are many issues involved in reproductive and genetic technologies which require control , and not just human cloning . 
Perhaps some of the amendments I have heard other members talk about should be in the bill . 
There is a lot at stake here . 
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT , 1997 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
Mr. Roy Bailey 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McLelland ) : 
I am also saddened to hear the opposition parties say that the United States have a better health system than we do . 
Once again , I think it is a lack of planning . 
That is about 70 % of the gross domestic product . 
The government has failed to do that . 
This used to be the rallying cry of parties seeking re - election , but not this Liberal government . 
Why should we as an industrialized country be in that position ? 
It is critical that we not only refuse to put additional charges on the Canadian credit card but that we have a solid financial plan to start paying down the huge debit balance and make the kind of prudent budget and lifestyle choices that will ensure our future fiscal well - being . 
They are not eligible for social assistance . 
In fact , there is appearance of conflict of interest and considering the importance of his position and the integrity with which he should manage the finances of the country , the finance minister should be clear of any suspicion . 
The ethics commissioner has made a detailed ruling with regard to this matter . 
For the information of members this is the report stage concurrence motion on which there is no debate . 
But , one election later , we are still trying to pass a bill that will harmonize our legislation with an international convention Canada helped negotiate . 
This young man , the member for Sherbrooke , who is leaving this House today deserves , as does his family , the support of all those who believe in this great and noble collective enterprise that Canada represents . 
Liberal backbenchers are squirming and crying out in pain because of their government ' s cruel and heartless torture of Canadians sick from tainted blood . 
Mr. Speaker , we were at the meeting and we did not discuss the need to change the bill . 
They simply do not want to accept the reality . 
When the government decided 10 years ago to compensate AIDS victims no one was more supportive than the Liberal opposition . 
Mr. Speaker , we are looking into the matter even as we speak . 
There is no doubt in my mind that they had only one goal and that is to serve their country well . 
For example , now that he is leaving for the Quebec National Assembly , will he recognize that Quebec is a nation ? 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully , too . 
This is a little humour here . 
Today there has been a lot of talk about Quebec and the Northwest Territories . 
Recent history shows that the Canadian government will use its power against its own employees to take away rights and discriminate against low paid workers . 
I would point out to the hon. member that all of the people who are serving in Bosnia and Haiti are in fact volunteers . 
There was some concern for the boundaries of the Tuktut Nogait park since this mineral find , or the proposed area where minerals may be , extends within the park ' s borders . 
What is proposed in Bill C - 208 ? 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
The many cliffs and ramparts provide ideal nesting areas for birds of prey . 
Elevated areas within the park ' s boundaries are designated as refugia . 
Agreed. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi ( Kitchener - Waterloo , Lib . ) : 
THE LATE ROB THOMPSON 
It does not make any sense . 
When we have these details , we will of course duly examine them and reply to the Government of Quebec after careful consideration of the matter . 
The hon. member should listen to the answer from the government in spite of the heckling from the Leader of the Opposition who is so undisciplined this morning . 
Evidence of this is our recent creation of a task force headed by Yvon Fontaine , in response to a recommendation by the Commissioner of Official Languages that the quality of official languages in the public service be improved , particularly in areas involving privatization , but also in all others . 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition contains 389 signatures . 
Originally Bill S - 3 provided that for plans being wound up if less than two thirds but more than one half of the employees consented , arbitration would be mandatory . 
What these appointments demonstrate is that the Senate is not working and it needs to be reformed. 
When a bill is under time allocation it is appropriate to debate the use of time allocation . 
I noted in her speech that she mentioned the modernization of the pension plan regime , and I would like to add to that : 
The bill would enable those responsible for children to make fully informed decisions about who they hire . 
The information would be provided to those individuals with responsibility for the child who are considering such an application . 
For that he should be congratulated. 
Mr. Lynn Myers 
CIGARETTE PRICES 
Mr. Julian Reed 
The government is taking a preventative approach to physical and mental health by optimizing early child development for all children and intervening early for at risk and marginalized children . 
Not much . 
We must divert our resources from the back end to the front end so that we do not have a continually expanding criminal justice system which simply eats away at more dollars and does not attack the real cause of crime . 
Studies prove that if we love and nurture , show affection to these little pieces of clay they will be honour students . 
In my mind this undertaking , the creation of the new territory of Nunavut , is a shining example of how we make progress in this country , of how we show that our federation works , of how we indicate to the rest of the world that we are unique and that we are building a democracy that is second to none . 
This senator is alleged to have accepted more than $ 200,000 from a Montreal businessman vying for government grants , using his influence as a senator to lobby on behalf of the business community for $ 45 million in federal - provincial grants . 
Time does not permit me to further elaborate on these defects of the old status quo Senate . 
While the process whereby Charlottetown was developed gave some belated attention to securing public input , mainly through the Spicer consultation , its Senate reform proposals were hardly more in tune with western Canadian thinking where Senate reform had been under active consideration for more than 10 years than those of Meech . 
In addition , the Charlottetown agreement seemed to imply that elected senators would be elected at large for each province with no provision for senatorial districts . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise in the House today to commemorate the 83 rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 1915 at the hands of the Turkish government , the first genocide of the 20 th century but sorrowfully not the last . 
One week they want one , the next , they no longer want one . 
Many of these victims are so sick they could hardly come to parliament today . 
The approach I have described was taken by all governments of all parties including the Progressive Conservative governments in Prince Edward Island , Ontario , Manitoba and Alberta . 
Now we find the real reason for delay is her lack of power or influence within her own caucus . 
What assurances can the minister give the House that federal departments are dealing with the urgency of the year 2000 crisis ? 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank this other member . 
A Senator shall not be a member of the Governor General in Council , or a director , officer , or member of a federal crown corporation , board , commission , agency or tribunal. 
Round and round we go . 
I will quote some statistics later on , in this regard . 
In particular , it looked at the transfer of services from the Government of the Northwest Territories to the new Government of Nunavut . 
Things have changed significantly . 
These recommendations were acted on in the following years . 
As it is now , we will not have an elected government on April 1 , 1999 . We will be able to hold an election after that date , but come April 1 , 1999 there will not be an elected government to take over if we do not allow this legislation to pass. 
The hon. member said previously that they are not as fortunate . 
I certainly would not agree with degradation from the hon. member opposite . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Hopefully at that point we will all be together , all partisan considerations aside , to rejoice with the people of Nunavut . 
The people of Nunavut should be consulted on how their senator is selected , the same as they have had a chance to voice their opinion on the many other political procedures that will govern them . 
When the hon. member comes along and plays Chicken Little , as the NDP has been doing for months now , the sky is falling and disaster is upon us , I would ask him to remember one thing . 
Investors are free in this country to invest in foreign assets . 
Hon. Allan Rock 
Mr. Bill Blaikie 
Hon. Don Boudria ( Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Do not go around getting 30,000 names or 10,000 names because the petition goes into some black hole in the House of Commons and you will get a letter back identifying the way things are , not the way things should be '' . 
In other words the House will have passed from the dark night of excessive party discipline into the bright sunshine of freer votes . 
The Bloc went back again and called for the witnesses to be heard again , as the Liberal member had told us in the House . 
The thinking behind this recommendation was to lead the House of Commons away " from the concept that everything in the House of Commons is controlled by the whips , the House leaders and the prime minister '' . 
I would like to see some experimentation with bringing some departmental estimates to the floor of the House of Commons for supply , similar to the committee of the whole process that takes place at present . 
The business of supply deals with the way parliament approves or grants to the government the funding it requires to carry out its programs and to govern the country for the ensuing year . 
We think this would keep everyone honest . 
We passed a motion in the House to refer to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs the matter of the statements made by certain MPs in the Ottawa Sun that , prima facie , constituted , or could constitute , breaches of the privileges of the House . 
I think that , just because there are only 20 of us , and that will soon drop to 19 , this is no reason why we should not have access to an amended parliamentary procedure allowing our amendments with respect to the throne speech to be voted on . 
At any other time when someone asks for permission to table a piece of paper , to put a motion before the House , any one person can stop that by saying no to the unanimous consent . 
What was involved was not $ 200,000 but millions . 
The other people do not even get a chance to have their names put on the list . 
Woburn is the first and only Canadian team to ever compete at this competition and was very proud to carry the Canadian flag and represent our country . 
On their behalf and on behalf of all those concerned with education , we call upon the government to begin addressing the serious financial crisis facing education in the country . 
The Speaker : 
For the Prime Minister , the incident is closed , but at the same time the Minister of Foreign Affairs is proposing the creation of an international commission of inquiry into the human rights situation in Chiapas . 
Will she introduce her legislation in time for parliament to properly review and consider it before the summer recess ? 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
It is from this perspective that the actions of the Department are of some concern . 
Mr. Speaker , in regard to that , you should also know that the issue will also be brought before the Joint Interparliamentary Council . 
That is a direct quote from the then minister of national defence . 
I suggest that Friday question periods be scheduled with regional ministers on a rotating basis , allowing greater debate on issues affecting each region or , in a related vein , that each Friday an assigned minister would be available for in - depth debate on specific issues relating to their portfolios . 
We are talking about the standing orders , the procedures , the traditions and certain things that require reform and change . 
I want to focus a bit on that . 
I do not know what it would take to get rid of that kind of procedure , but it would be nice to tell members they have the freedom to vote in the House according to how the people want to be represented. 
The trick with all adaptations of the standing orders is that they be effective for the particular parliamentary situation of the day without undermining the intrinsic long term strength of the standing orders , a foundation of our parliamentary system . 
* * * 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
As far as businesses are concerned , as soon as there is a question of commercial relations , of competition , there are also provisions to protect companies , even the three crown corporations currently under discussion , which would now be subject to the act . 
It allows federal institutions to withhold information , the release of which would be injurious to the commercial interests of those organizations and more importantly to the interests of Canada . 
I want to reassure the member for Waterloo - Wellington that the ministry of the solicitor general is in no way considering privatizing correctional services . 
Hon. Anne McLellan 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom 
I guess that means she will get back to us . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
That is the fact of the matter . 
The minister must get moving .

IMMIGRATION 
This report is deemed adopted on presentation . 
c ) All funds were utilized through this program . 
Without this bill Nunavut would not have a fully elected territorial leadership from its beginning days . 
I think it is a great opportunity . 
Bill S - 3 amends the Pension Benefits Standards Act , 1985 and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act , enhancing the powers of the superintendent to supervise the management of private pension plans . 
I agree but , as I said earlier , part of me has trouble suppressing my cynicism when the same government says that it should supervise pension funds so that everything goes well and it has such a terrible track record with its own pension fund , the Canada pension plan . 
In the House 60 % of the representatives come from Quebec and Ontario . 
So why bother ? 
I have two small children at home , a two - year old and a four - year old . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to speak to the following motion by the member for Acadie - Bathurst : 
The government would have already taken steps to remove the product from the market . 
" TAGS was based on two fundamental premises which have proven incorrect . 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
Hon. Allan Rock 
SUPPLY 
Since its inception a net revenue , revenue minus refunds , of $ 458.5 M has been generated. 
I am going to table this so that the Prime Minister can read something he should have known . 
It calls this an issue of money . 
Last September at a meeting in Fredericton , Canada ' s health ministers built on the substantial progress that had already been made and made a decisive step forward in the creation of a new , single agency to manage Canada ' s blood system . 
I think everyone in the House knows that . 
Canadians would have a lot more confidence in a system in which that did not take place as often as it does . 
Mr. Speaker , on such a serious topic as this I hope you will interrupt me if I engage in shameful partisan snipping . 
Why can the federal health minister not do the honourable thing , save face in some manner , do some supplementary program and compensate all victims ? 
Madam Speaker , I touched on this point a little in my presentation . 
Did we hear from the opposition before on this issue ? 
For God ' s sake vote for these victims . 
I will not read the entire letter because I do not have time . 
Let us also not forget that this is the same Reform Party whose leader has labelled groups representing battered women as " special interest groups " and refused to even meet with them . 
They found that the Irish formula was tailored to Ireland ' s very specific circumstances , and that it would not suit Canada ' s circumstances . 
I must stand in my place and make a compelling case for the victims of hepatitis C from my riding and across this country that this is morally wrong . 
I commend them for their uncompromising efforts and tireless work on the erection of a monument which will be inscribed with the following words : 
Mr. Speaker , I am wondering whether the hon. member considers that the Quebec minister of health has abandoned victims of hepatitis C , because he agrees with us . 
As I mentioned on Tuesday , there are ongoing meetings this week and next week concerning these very matters . 
In the evening we plan to hold a special take note debate on Bosnia . 
That is all we are asking . 
That is what is wrong with politics in Canada today . 
Mr. John Nunziata : 
Mr. Dick Harris : 
Mr. Speaker , if this unites Canadians against what the government stands for on this issue , so be it . 
The true question is whether governments should make cash payments to those who are harmed through no fault of anyone but because of risk inherent in the medical system . 
Their recommendation was to do exactly what ministers have done in this case , which is good public policy . 
How large that number is is not my present concern , but it is clear that the Supreme Court has regarded this organization as worth hearing in court since it has consistently granted REAL Women intervenor status . 
We have also experienced significant difficulties on behalf of our constituents with disability pensions . 
The inequality that has existed with respect to historically disadvantaged groups is justification for preserving such a program . 
There are other means by which , as they say , poor dispossessed groups that do not have the resources can achieve resource to take issues to the courts . 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
Hon. David M. Collenette 
Overall , the Canadian Environmental Protection Act covers pollution prevention , managing toxic substances , clean air and water , controlling pollution and waste . 
I have talked about the jurisdictional issues . 
Recent polls , newspaper forums and radio hot - lines all agree . 
I can assure them they will not be disappointed. 
CANADIAN ARMED FORCES 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Joseph Volpe ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , our approach is to ensure that Canadian forces personnel are protected. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak - Lindell ( Nunavut , Lib . ) : 
I move : 
Although in theory Bill C - 32 recognizes that responsibility for the environment is shared between the federal government and the provinces , in practice it delegates no powers to them , and this runs counter to real environmental harmonization between the various levels of government . 
All species suffered : the wildlife , the flora and the fauna . 
In the province of Ontario one of the minister ' s officials stated in committee on February 26 that if there are not the resources for a CEPA regulation that needs to be investigated , then it basically sits in a file until an investigator is freed up . 
If we look at the cuts in the federal environment department , how are they going to properly enforce an act when , because of the huge cuts , they do not know who will enforce it ? 
Canada must be ready to face the challenge of globalization . 
This government is committed to taking a balanced approach to reducing crime in Canada which includes the underlying factors that lead to criminal behaviour . 
It is incumbent on all of us to recognize that and to do what little part we can to make sure that they know and that the families of those who have died in the line of duty know how important Canadians regard their work , understand it , and consider with compassion the circumstance in which they find themselves having lost a loved one . 
It being 2.25 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until Monday at 11 a.m. , pursuant to Standing Order 24 ( 1 ) . 
Hon. Allan Rock 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
As for fishery policy one could easily devote more than one speech to the federal idiocy of a race based aboriginal fishery with no help to the salmon negotiations with the U.S. 
They are even going to decide whether a majority of people voted affirmatively in the riding . 
What we have here is a pizza parliament . 
In order for environmental goals and targets to be met it is essential that an open dialogue representing social , scientific , technical and economic considerations be held . 
For example , the right to sue provisions contained within the bill may be improved if amended so that the government is made a mandatory party to any suit . 
These members reported recently that in 1996 emissions of a number of toxic substances such as zinc , benzene , lead and copper were reduced by over 5,000 tonnes , a decrease of 27 % from 1995 emission levels . 
As things were not solid to start with and the position of the Government of Canada was taken at the last minute , there is no consensus on this position . 
Bill C - 32 allows for creative approaches in controlling toxic substances . 
I really have a problem with people in certain branches of the environmental movement who use the argument that we can never be certain about anything before we take action , that we have to take a preventive stance even if we do not know what we are doing , just in case . 
We must ensure that the readily available information on pesticide use on Canadian lawns and in agriculture is provided and is not only industry based. 
Mr. Speaker , in assessing the motion before the House on hepatitis C it is important that we look beyond the rhetoric to its real implication for Canadian society . 
Mr. Speaker , I am surprised at the hon. member ' s question because if there is one thing the Prime Minister is not it is shy . 
As a result of those efforts and that commitment some 22,000 - plus Canadians will not have to go to court if they accept the offer that we have made in compensation . 
HEPATITIS C 
Last November the solicitor general promised to introduce legislation to give police power to act on illegal financial activity . 
The hon. member is correct in that the Prime Minister did ask a number of ministers to look at the post - TAGS situation . 
If my memory serves me right , it was shortly after the 1984 election that he was given something in the nature of six months to live . 
Carlo Rossi ' s name was already known in this House before he was first elected to this place in 1979 to represent the riding of Bourassa , which encompasses Montr é al - Nord in the greater Montreal area . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to say this is a very timely bill but I would be incorrect if I said that . 
Moreover , the new act provides for the setting up of a reward program recognizing the industry ' s voluntary efforts to prevent pollution . 
In addition , businesses improved their operating methods , based on the technologies then available . 
Globalization , new technologies and deregulation are key forces of change that have been at work making our financial industry more modern and more efficient . 
I know that because I had to learn it many years ago . 
I had an opportunity recently to visit the official website of the Reform Party where I read inflammatory and factually incorrect statements about members of the Senate . 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau 
HEPATITIS C 
Mr. Gilles Bernier 
We will see it this afternoon . 
I guarantee that this committee would allow us , as members of Parliament , to be forward - thinking at the international level and find concrete solutions to the issue of the lack of power of our respective seats in the context of globalization . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe : 
Is that his answer ? 
We have mutual funds . 
Those two things acting together , often synthesized by a Liberal government at the federal level , have led to the kind of country which is now being dismantled by the very globalization model the member for Lac - Saint - Jean refers to , which we in the NDP have been criticizing for some time . 
Those exports are extremely important to Quebec . Those figures have helped to stabilize the employment levels in Quebec , not destabilize them . 
It is also important for Canadians to remember that the Multilateral Agreement on Investment includes about 90 % of Chapter 11 of NAFTA , dealing with investments . 
Once a country has abandoned a measure it is for good , it cannot be reactivated. 
We should just settle down . 
We already have 50,000 of them and , if more are needed , we will get them . 
But before we support this agreement , we must get right to the bottom of an aspect of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Federal , provincial and territorial governments will work together to fully develop the national children ' s agenda , one of the most significant social policy initiatives in 30 years . 
The best way to address child poverty is to address the needs of the family . 
Tonight all members of parliament have a chance to do the right thing , to stand up for the rights of victims . 
I ask again , in the name of compassion and fairness , why will the government not allow the MPs to vote for these victims ? 
I think if Liberal members have a choice , and they have a choice , they would much rather stand with the Prime Minister than with the hon. member and her colleagues . 
My colleagues , we are listening to the questions and we should give the ministers or whomever the chance to make their responses . 
* * * 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendent . 
The Government of Canada has clearly indicated that these are our values and priorities . 
This is our focus in the discussion on poverty . 
Why have so many governments opened up , willingly or not , to the world economy ? 
The city of Montreal , where I live , is more and more frequently smothered in smog . 
For Canadians , there has never been a better time for exports and for taking advantage of international investment opportunities . 
It is with pleasure that I rise today to support the motion of the member of the Bloc Quebecois . 
Those of us from the regions must raise these issues . 
I invite my colleague opposite to visit Newfoundland , since his government wants to abolish the TAGS program . 
The reason for poverty is the $ 600 billion in accumulated debt that has been run up in past years , because of needless national spending . 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT , 1998 
Next week , the Co - operative Housing Federation of Canada , CHF Canada , will meet with the minister responsible for CMHC and propose that a new non - profit , non - governmental organization be set up to administer co - op housing agreements . 
The decision to offer the transfer of administration of social housing resources to provincial and territorial governments was made in order to clarify responsibilities in the area where both Canadian and provincial governments are active . 
It has to go back and renegotiate with the provinces to find a way to ensure that there is provincial involvement but , critically , federal involvement to ensure there is further development in social housing and co - operative housing in Canada . 
As a result some 20,000 mines have been lifted in the last year under SFOR monitoring . 
His was the best in the community . 
I would like to quote a friend , someone I met on my trip to Sarajevo in Bosnia , a young Quebec woman who is serving as the deputy ombudsman for Bosnia - Hercegovina and who introduced me to a magnificent work I recommend you read . 
None of these things is designed to provide any confidence in the ability of our armed forces to do the job that is asked of them . 
It is not that our military do not enjoy their work , but in the end the difference in the quality of life in the armed forces and in the private sector becomes too great . 
There is a second element . 
Mr. Speaker , allow me first to congratulate you on the daily improvement of your French . 
Today our air personnel play an important role in NATO ' s aerial surveillance missions . 
War hurts everybody . 
I did not expect any more of the Prime Minister or of the government whip . 
Mrs. Pauline Picard 
Mr. Nelson Riis 
It is therefore important that the Canadian consensus be put forth again before the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe , which will make a final decision on this recommendation . 
With all their differences they make the desert bloom and democracy work . 
My question is for the Prime Minister . 
Let me ask the Prime Minister , why is he forcing Joey and others like him to go to court for compensation ? 
Will he put forward today , table the documents today , to show how many hepatitis C victims were infected by hepatitis C contaminated blood before 1986 ? 
* * * 
Therefore these petitioners pray that parliament will review the mandate of the CRTC and direct the CRTC to administer a new policy which will encourage the licensing of religious broadcasters . 
I can understand why . 
NAFO ' s responsibilities include straddling stocks on the nose and tail of the Grand Banks and other fish stocks on the Flemish Cap , a part of Canada ' s continental shelf which lies outside our 200 mile limit . 
The agreement included : independent , full time observers to be on board vessels at all times ; enhanced surveillance by satellite tracking ; increased inspections and quick reporting of infractions ; verification of gear and catch records ; timely and significant penalties to deter violators ; new minimum fishing size limits ; and improved dockside monitoring . 
To ensure that vessels abide by the new international rules , the new UN convention authorizes Canada to take action outside 200 miles where the flag state fails to control its vessels . 
It allows the custody and seizure of vessels , the seizure or delivery into the custody of such person the minister may direct . 
The government should be here announcing that it will not go back on its word , that it will honour its commitment to continue to pay recipients of TAGS until May 1999 who are now overtaking federal offices in Newfoundland out of frustration . 
I know that this is not easy for those listening at home , so I will try to explain . 
That is how we managed to stop that Spanish boat , the Estai '' . 
I would ask for unanimous consent for the intent of this bill , the wording , to be drawn to the attention of the justice committee to become part of what it is doing in terms of improving Canadian law . 
Part of the reason people argue against this kind of bill is that the court cannot foresee what will happen to an offender in two years . 
Again the institutional head may authorize escorted temporary absences at his discretion . 
That is all that I have to say . 
Mr. Peter Goldring 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
Canadians value safety and security . 
As an example I would cite the U.S. State Department ' s report , " International Narcotics Control Strategy '' , which singled out Canada as an easy target for drug related and other types of money laundering . 
Hon. Don Boudria : 
I will return the compliment by pointing out that he has made changes at the request of the Bloc Quebecois and others by withdrawing the clauses on mandatory registration as well as the charges for small vessels . 
Reforming the outdated shipping act is important and it can provide significant benefits for Canada such as more employment and business opportunities for Canadians , a rejuvenated marine infrastructure and better service for Canadian exporters . 
If the minister really wants to think about conservation , let him do so . 
In a coastal area like mine , fish is the principal resource , and one which provides the local people with seasonal employment . 
This means that the crab industry alone is already experiencing twice as many problems . 
The unions have no jurisdiction or control . 
George ' s to address the comments he made to the members of parliament from Ontario who , indeed , support , in every way possible , the government moving on a new TAGS . 
Aside from the fact that in a community like mine in Mississauga there are a lot of transplants from Newfoundland and Labrador , I spoke up because of what I saw as misleading information , a lobby campaign funded by American money , a lobby campaign designed to mislead the Canadian public . 
One reason might be that Canada has a case pending in the International Court of Justice in The Hague . 
On the international scene there are powerful interests at work and if we snooze , we lose . 
I understand the hon. member is familiar with the issue , but I would like to see if he will be more progressive than his party , he who had such progressive ideas regarding Bill C - 27 . 
Mr. Guy St - Julien ( Abitibi , Lib . ) : 
ISRAEL 
It is the principle . 
This has never been a political issue and we should not be making it into a political issue . 
We took on that problem and we are doing what a responsible government has to do , which is to compensate when it has responsibility . 
The hon. member refers to Manitoba . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask the government House leader the business remaining for this week and the business for next week . 
He told me all that he was doing in his riding and said that debates in the House were not necessarily his priority . 
They want to define programs in terms of an economic value , forgetting about the social hardships being caused and what has to be done to alleviate them . 
For example , the maximum penalty for pain and suffering would increase to $ 20,000 from $ 5,000 . 
I am appalled to see conditional sentencing for people who physically and / or sexually attack a fellow citizen . 
I can certainly see where it would be valid for us to say that a person must do , and this bills talks about it , everything possible to accommodate the needs of a person who is disabled. 
We will see how existing case law incorporates this new provision . 
Again it sends an important message . 
The crisis is jeopardizing our children ' s healthy development , undermines school readiness , and ultimately threatens our economy . 
There is an obvious risk that the male partner may ask his female partner to stay home and look after the children , in order to take advantage of this tax measure . 
The current income tax system attempts to strike a balance between treating all individuals the same and considering different family circumstances . 
The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with provinces , industries and other stakeholders so that all Canadians , including our young people , can assume their rightful place in the workforce . 
Mr. Jacques Saada 
Mr. Nick Discepola 
Like the education authorities , this corporation will be governed by a constitution that ensures a fair and open accountability regime and dispute resolution process . 
Where will they understand brotherhood ? 
It is interesting that Phil Fontaine has referred to this bill as a historic piece of legislation . 
In 1998 , 58 % of workers in Quebec are not unionized. 
After all , if anyone has a right to be angry , it is the provinces themselves . 
My colleague , please address your questions through the Chair . 
In reply to a question which I asked a few weeks ago to his colleague , the environment minister , the Minister of Natural Resources said , and I quote " With respect to the need to expand in terms of renewable energy , alternative sources of energy , co - generation projects and so forth , indeed those are very much a part of our agenda to deal with climate change '' . 
Was there no lack of principle there ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
With respect to aboriginal fishing activities in British Columbia during the period from March 31 , 1992 , to November 30 , 1997 , with the exception of salmon and herring fisheries : ( a ) which aboriginal groups received communal licences or other authorization to fish excluding commercial fishing licences of the same type issued to the all - canadian commercial fishing fleet in British Columbia ; ( b ) what period did each licence include ; ( c ) what species did each licence include ; ( d ) what quantity of each species could be harvested under each licence ; ( e ) what quantity of each species was reported as harvested under each licence ; ( f ) what evidence does the Department of Fisheries and Oceans ( DFO ) possess to conclude that these aboriginal groups have an aboriginal right to harvest the species for which the licence was issued in the area in which the fishing activities take place ; ( g ) what evidence of pre - contact harvesting of the species did the aboriginal groups provide to convince DFO such that they now ought to be awarded an aboriginal licence ; ( h ) were any coastal waters of British Columbia closed either permanently or temporarily to fishing by other Canadians to accommodate these aboriginal fisheries ; ( i ) if certain areas were closed , which areas , for what period and to accommodate which aboriginal group fishing and for which species ; ( j ) what evidence does DFO possess to conclude that an area closure was necessary to protect the claimed aboriginal fishing right ; and ( k ) in the absence of a proven aboriginal right to fish , on what grounds or on what basis does DFO close waters to fishing by Canadians other than those belonging to a designated aboriginal group ? 
Many people would like to forget the band system in Canada , which this new educational policy would help to perpetuate , was the model for South Africa ' s system of homelands . 
We are isolating and doing the very thing that he is trying to purport he is not doing , which is segregating and separating . 
Some hon. members : 
Canadians are gradually catching on to the deception of life imprisonment . 
That displays an attitude that is all too prevalent in those who are responsible for the direction that our justice system has been taking , certainly during the last five years since I have been a member of this House . 
I would suggest that serious sexual assaults and violence should never be considered by judges for the imposition of conditional sentences . 
It was an accident . 
ELIZABETH FRY WEEK 
Mr. Peter Mancini 
Had parental rights been in the charter it may have actually resulted in the bureaucrats conducting a proper investigation before scooping the Butlers ' kids and keeping them separated for six months . 
I therefore do not understand what the risks are to which families and children are exposed and which the motion before us seeks to eliminate . 
To me this is trying to strengthen the family unit rather than break it up . 
The very essence of rights legislation is to define the limitations of the state or the group on actions of the individual. 
Mr. Speaker , I support the points which my hon. colleague has made . 
I apologize for rising but on this point I do want to bring to the House ' s attention that this grouping I suggest is inappropriate in the sense that Motions Nos. 1 and 2 have absolutely nothing to do and have no bearing on Motions Nos. 3 and 5 . 
My amendment is Motion No. 2 , the ( a ) portion of which appears to already be accepted as it is provided in the act . 
Yet when all the evidence is on the table , these people turn out to be totally innocent . 
My constituents and a host of others inside and outside the law enforcement community are very disappointed with what the Liberals have done with this bill . 
Why does the government not put in place something that would help these innocent people be free ? 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
On Saturday the Senators defeated the New Jersey Devils four games to two , eliminating the Devils from the Stanley Cup finals . 
Mr. Speaker , as the Deputy Prime Minister has said , we learned just moments ago of the apparent change in Ontario ' s position , I think the third position in the last five days . 
I will be speaking with Clay Serby who is the minister from Saskatchewan , this year ' s chair for the provincial ministers . 
Hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
It has concluded the investigation . 
Mr. Julian Reed ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade , Lib . ) : 
With regard to recent changes in the tax treaty between the United States and Canada , which restore a tax exemption from U.S. federal income taxes to all Canadians who received U.S. social security or railroad retirement in 1996 and 1997 , what measures has the Minister of National Revenue taken to ensure a speedy refund to eligible recipients of the excess taxes that were deducted for tax years 1996 and 1997 ? 
On that level that is the only caution I give to NDP Motion No. 2 . 
I was remarking on the heckle of a member opposite who said what a waste of time to have a quorum call . 
This identifies me as a unique person . 
Although I have still not received the written decisions of the supreme court justices that were referred to earlier on a point of order , it is my understanding that they concur with my interpretation of the difference between fingerprinting and DNA analysis . 
It is tampering with the safeguards that presently exist . 
It is precisely in this connection that we have Motion No. 4 which pertains to clause 9 ( 2 ) . 
I move to Motion No. 6 in Group No. 2 . The motion was made by one of our colleagues in the third party . 
No one was there and no one was hurt . 
We want to ensure that the rights of the accused are balanced in the justice system . 
He can use my blood sample in any way he wants . 
I think it is timely . 
Mr. Grant Hill 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
Mr. Rey D . Pagtakhan 
There have been some chinks in the armour and these petitions will carry on until that takes place . 
As I said a minute ago , medicare was Saskatchewan ' s gift to Canada . 
Normally a screening test would be done to look for liver damage . 
Should there be fair and equitable compensation for all victims who contracted hepatitis C from tainted blood , as there was for those who contracted HIV , or should there not ? 
The government ' s position is completely untenable . 
There were a lot of them squirming in their seats just a week ago when they had to vote to deny compensation for those innocent victims . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
Also the motion is very clear with respect to the fact that the meeting involve federal , provincial and territorial health ministers . 
Their importance has been recognized in the decision to involve consumer groups in the negotiated court approved settlement process announced on March 27 . 
In effect , Liberal members decided to hide behind a rock of silence . 
Out of respect for his position as Leader of the Opposition of Her Royal Majesty and at the same time out of humility , can the Leader of the Opposition acknowledge once and for all and say the right thing , that it was this Minister of Health who advanced this issue of compensation for the victims of hepatitis C in Canada by convening the ministers of health across the country to the table ? 
I can tell you , Mr. Speaker , that had it not been for the Minister of Health this issue would never have reached the table . 
You are on debate . 
Vote for us '' . 
All of them are stretched to the limit . 
As a member representing an anglophone riding in the heart of southwestern Ontario , I want to say that my Canada includes Quebec . 
Mr. Greg Thompson ( Charlotte , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , surely the hon. member knows that there is a spousal credit already built into the system . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Transport . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
I did not hear the Right Hon. Prime Minister refer to a document . 
We must not loose site of the fact that blood transfusion is often a life saving treatment and that many of those who acquired hepatitis C from transfusions prior to 1986 are alive today only because they received this blood . 
I say that for a couple of reasons . 
However , a number of Liberals must surely be hanging their heads pretty low , especially those who were elected on principles of defending the public and working on behalf of the poor . 
What has the United Kingdom done ? 
This motion by the NDP is a good motion and . 
I do not know if the hon. member has been to Germany , but I have been to Germany . 
The Minister of Health stood in the House and said it was not about money . 
Whatever one might believe about the Minister of Health , the fact is he took the file forward , he got agreement with the provinces and now we are into debate . 
( The House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
As soon as the student defaults their file is deferred to a collection agency which is charged with the task of harassing , degrading and browbeating a young person into submission . 
Students will be able to study almost anywhere in Canada . 
That addresses two of the big problems . 
He sleeps on a foamy . 
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement Ethyl Corporation in the United States was enabled to sue the Canadian government for $ 350 million for banning the dangerous and toxic substance MMT from gasoline . 
I simply point out to my colleague that $ 3 million has been set aside for active measures for the approximately 300 miners who are affected and there has been substantial uptake of those initiatives . 
Hon. Charles Caccia 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay 
Today reservists can wear their uniforms to work to display the pride they have in serving their country and to allow their employers a chance to show their support for reservist employees . 
Mr. Speaker , it is not a question of insults . 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne ( Saint John , PC ) : 
The Speaker : 
There is a public discussion going on about the role of the department which must be carefully considered by this government before a decision is made . 
The port of Grande Anse , of growing importance in the development of the region ' s economy , was another of the major projects for which he was responsible . 
PUBLIC NUDITY 
I have already spoken to some extent about the examination and admission processes which are under the auspices of the board of examiners . 
That all stages of Bill C - 31 , including second reading , committee of the whole and third reading , be completed today , and that all questions necessary for the completion of those stages be put no later than 5.30 p.m. 
Madam Speaker , I would like to thank the member for Humber - St. 
Madam Speaker , I think you would find unanimous consent that at the completion of deliberations on Bill C - 31 the House will call no further business but will see the clock as standing at 5.30 p.m. and proceed to Private Members ' Business . 
He became leader of the Liberal Party in 1887 following Edward Blake ' s resignation . 
I appreciate that the hon. member opposite finds Laurier an instructive and inspiring leader and I respect that fact , but I do not feel the need at this point in time to name a day after him . 
Some of the challenges which he met , members of this House have also met . 
Instead of encouraging individual responsibility , the proposed benefit will discourage everybody from saving for their retirement , except for the wealthiest people . 
Considering that the federal government proposes that the Yukon government assume responsibility for the administration and control of lands , forest , water and mineral resources , I call on the government to modernize the Yukon Act so it is consistent with the powers currently exercised by the Yukon government and the powers to be conferred on the new territory of Nunavut . 
Mr. Dale Johnston 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
I would like to know when I can expect an answer to this question . 
I would like to turn my attention now to the motions in Group No. 1 . 
There are numerous amendments that we are considering today at this stage of examining the bill . 
What we have is a situation now where the parties that truly rely on the labour code , the federally regulated employers , the employees who work for them and their representatives , are eager to see Bill C - 19 moved forward . 
The hon. member for North Vancouver has the floor . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Some hon. members : 
This provision simply clarifies the board ' s authority to make determinations based on the written evidence and representations of the parties where the facts of the case are not in dispute . 
Let us hope that the industrial relations portion of the bill has made some improvement here . 
The point is that it is the government ' s responsibility to get its legislation through . 
In our opinion , Motion No. 7 allows strikebreakers to be used , in that they could vote for a bargaining unit , which we find excessive and unacceptable . 
In the OLRB ' s view , the managers ' refusal to answer was such a grievous violation of workers rights that it invalidated not only that vote but any future votes as well . 
Recently we have the realization that the Windsor store alone voted 151 to 43 in favour of the union ' s being decertified. 
It is important that it address the issues that are of concern in the labour industry . 
That is why this competition is important . 
It will be a rational approach to the problem . 
Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I said just a moment ago that the best way to ensure negotiations are successful is to not conduct them in public . 
We will not make a decision until they are . 
The hon. Minister of Justice . 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
We all know that is incorrect , not appropriate , not proper and does not occur . 
They all stand up like hordes of sheep and vote collectively . 
I belonged to the pulp and paper workers union when I worked in a pulp mill in Kitimat , British Columbia , in the mid - seventies . 
However , those members never talk about that . 
Clause 46 allows the board to certify a trade union despite lack of evidence of majority support . 
It has been mentioned today how undemocratic things are not only in some areas of the labour process and the labour force but also in this House of Commons . 
All these things could strengthen labour laws , strengthen the individual ' s position rather than strengthening the position of the union leadership . 
That just rubs the wrong way any Canadian who believes in democracy , who believes that people have a right to make decisions for the best of the majority in the situation . 
In the auditor general ' s words it was still too early to determine whether FedNor is adequately monitoring its projects . 
Canada Business Service Centres , les Centres de services aux entreprises du Canada , are an important element in this economic development . 
I was paying taxes and I was not making a whole lot of money , but when my son was sick he could go to the hospital and it did not cost me anything . 
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper . 
Hon. Herb Gray 
Mr. Bernard Patry 
The parties could freely negotiate and at the end of the day it would be settled by arbitrators and life would go on without a lot of difficulty . 
In terms of Motion No. 30 , we support this amendment which we are bringing forward . 
Unfortunately we do not see that applied often in much of the legislation that is produced in the House . 
This year , this special week is devoted to bringing the police and the community closer together . 
This Liberal government shirked its responsibility in those days . 
Mr. Speaker , he should explain why , in spite of Mr. Krever ' s findings in his report , he said the provinces should do the compensating . 
INFORMATION COMMISSIONER 
I should say the good news is that there is more shrimp available this year than last . 
Public rumour has it that the ICO will now come under the Minister of Public Works , who is already responsible for ensuring the government ' s visibility , or the Privy Council Office . 
Mr. Keith Martin : 
We asked formally if we could get out of the union . 
Imagine , freedom . 
We have that special power available only to government ministers and we can tell that they did not really mean it , so we will override their democratic choice and we will get them to join that union whether they like it or not '' . 
And more than five members having risen : 
It is sometimes quite overt . 
What does that do to create planning , consistency and the confidence that this will work ? 
Canadians do not want their health spending , education assistance or old age security cut by $ 4.4 billion . 
The federal government should not be looking after the rural road system . 
Finally , the committee recommended that the federal government should review its application of cost recovery to services provided in rural Canada to ensure that undue financial burdens are not imposed on industries operating in rural and remote communities . 
Mr. Monte Solberg 
Hon. Herb Gray 
Mr. Mark Muise 
Second , these producers would be chosen from names submitted by special grains commodities groups . 
He has his roots in the soil but they are growing in the wrong direction ; instead of up they are going down and when they are down they go up . 
Even a kid in grade four could understand it . 
The Canadian Wheat Board does not offer any elevators to take the specialty crop. 
Nay . 
This is the reason farmers are very hesitant to approve something they do not have control over . 
Since then , however , it has slashed funding to education , social assistance and health . 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Preston Manning 
Bill C - 19 . Report stage 
Motion No. 12 negatived 
I was wondering when I could expect an answer to that question . 
Mr. Speaker , I know there are only a couple of minutes left so I will attempt to summarize very briefly my comments on the bill and on the amendments . 
Unfortunately members on the Liberal side seem to think it is all right to shut down democratic debate . 
The fact that the government put the 40 th time allocation since it has been in office shows that government members have had little will or little backbone to stand up to the department . 
The service is well respected and the important role of the head of the FMCS in advising the Minister of Labour on dispute resolution will be formally recognized in the code . 
That Bill C - 19 , in Clause 37 , be amended by deleting lines 7 to 31 on page 28 . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
This government has used a dispute settlement mechanism over and over in the past in conjunction with back to work legislation . 
Many of the motions we are dealing with today would tend to upset that delicate balance and would jeopardize the success of the whole process . 
It was the very person who introduced the motion to invoke time allocation upon this bill . 
* * * 
It tends to distort everything . 
Do they really want to pay for her fund ?

Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
We have asked MPs of Italian origin from all parties in the House to represent our country to enhance our trading and otherwise - 
Does the government intend to support this legislation , which is meant as a concrete measure against poverty ? 
It was determined in that process that fusion research which has a payback that is at least 30 to 40 years in the future could not at this time be a priority . 
The area I would like to discuss stems from my role as critic for international trade . 
That is our motive and that is what we want to do in a very balanced , sensible and thoughtful way . 
Agreed. 
It is so strongly opposed that it wants to eliminate every term that prevents the hiring of scabs or replacement workers . 
If there is a work stoppage of any type that has a tremendously adverse effect on the economy , it is the little people who support those businesses and who depend on those services who are ultimately hurt . 
That is still a problem today . 
They say it should all be done in committee . 
Mr. Speaker , I notice you are signalling that my time is up . 
A recorded division on Motion No. 21 stands deferred. 
See list under Division No. 139 ]

Mr. Giordano has just been awarded the title of Olympic official , class 3 , world class by the International Amateur Athletic Federation . 
As a government and a political party , we are firmly committed to fight the threat of poverty . 
Will Canada , which until now has been content to have the Prime Minister announce timid measures against India , review its position and implement real political and economic sanctions , as the United States is doing ? 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
We have cancelled a pending joint ministerial committee .

Could he tell the House what is so secretive about the government doling out taxpayers ' dollars to Bombardier ? 
Motion No. 14 
" 38 . 
Perhaps I can clarify the situation . 
Then it steps in with a fund that is clearly in provincial jurisdiction and wants to get credit for fixing the problem it created. 
The hon. member ' s motion gives the Minister of Finance the power to remove the auditor chosen by the foundation . 
The board will name its own auditor , state its own salaries , hand out taxpayers ' dollars on merit - whatever that might be - or need , or both , ignoring the fact that provinces and the federal government and , for that matter , private industry already have bursaries , loans , grants and award programs in place to help students who demonstrate that merit and need. 
Funding to the provinces for education has been cut by $ 6 billion . 
By being fiscally irresponsible and spending more than we take in , we compromise the social programs we profess to help by spending more on those programs than we take in . 
This act embodies many of the concerns felt by our premiers and is a blueprint for positive change . 
Some hon. members : 
Any federal riding having an unemployment rate equal to or higher than the national average unemployment rate would be designated as disadvantaged. 
Not only that one , but we could go right across Canada and most of our major centres would qualify as disadvantaged communities under that definition . 
Moneys are taken from those communities , whether in deposits , in RRSP contributions , in mutual funds or in other investment vehicles to be invested in other areas , most of them being the major financial centres , the larger centres in eastern Canada .

Maybe they consider they have indoor swimming pools . 
They do not have enough time to be properly trained and to set up a proper team . 
After all there is a $ 600 billion debt . 
But unfortunately we are looking at a government today that is somewhat dictatorial in its viewpoints and likes that control . 
I must admit that it is not clear whether this is only a Liberal scandal or also a Conservative scandal , as this whole thing started under Prime Minister Campbell , who ran in the 1993 campaign . 
They took off their robes and started singing " The Band Played Waltzing Matilda " which is a very poignant song about a young Australian soldier going to Gallipoli , fighting in that war and then returning with his legs blown off . 
In particular , they were offered very limited career training opportunities . 
It also promised to scrap the GST , another thing it has not done . 
Numerous initiatives are under way and we are seeing excellent progress . 
An independent ombudsman to enhance fairness within the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces is in the process of being established. 
I am not condemning talking to people , listening to the rank and file and not just the officers and the politicians . 
Quite frankly I find that year after year the condemnation of the military and its plans and movements is wrong . 
As a matter of fact , they were among the leading drill teams across Ontario . 
That is our vision . 
But above all , the people in the military are calling out for some kind of leadership from this government .

Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
We do have a very complete safety net system in place , crop insurance as well as NISA , the net income stabilization program for Canadian farmers . 
We have a proud military tradition in this country . 
Certainly the world has changed greatly over the 1990 s . 
Mr. Gordon Earle ( Halifax West , NDP ) : 
I must respond to the question of the hon. member for Nepean - Carleton regarding whether it demonstrates great political leadership and wisdom to convene the committee to hear frankly from military men and women about pay and rations . 
In addition to this report , the minister has asked prominent Canadians to participate in the minister ' s monitoring committee on change , which will report semi - annually to him on the department ' s progress . 
As my colleague mentioned this afternoon , our Canadian forces have been asked to assist with the tragic mud slides in Italy . 
It is not a good ratio . 
Our soldiers have no boots . 
I do not know that many people in this Chamber would go back to the first world war . 
I believe there are things the government can do . 
This scientist applauds the absence of legislation in the United States ; there is nothing preventing him from going ahead with his project . 
I concur in principle with the thrust of the bill , its prohibitions on the cloning of the human embryo and of genetic manipulation that could allow the transmission of an altered genetic structure to a subsequent generation . 
If he did get down to our area and saw the poverty in which people are living , he would not be long in noticing that his 80 % figure does not exist .

It will enable the longshore industry to retain grain vessel work , but will remove grain from the equation in longshore collective bargaining . 
They say that the bill will have a direct impact on labour relations and in their words it will strike a balance . 
I have said before in this House when talking on agriculture bills , the problems of production are largely overcome , except for natural disasters which are caused by weather related problems . 
For example , we can look at the 1994 west coast port strike in which the direct costs of the strike were estimated to be more than $ 125 million . 
The family plays a vital role in the well - being of humankind . 
How could this minister have gone to those meetings without a well researched , well thought out federal government position ? 
Will the health minister now admit that he sabotaged the hepatitis C talks yesterday by failing to put any federal money on the table ? 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the member that it is through the leadership of the Prime Minister and his government that 22,000 people who contracted hepatitis C through the blood system have been offered very reasonable compensation and assistance . 
The Canadian consensus is clear , fair compensation for all . 
Some hon. members : 
As there is a lengthy list attached to the motion , if it is agreeable to the House , I would ask that the list be printed in Hansard as if it had been read . 
c . Did the individual sell the fish to a third party and , if so , was he paid for them ?

The 21 right to work states are not free for workers . 
It is unethical and it gives the employer another chance to use intimidation and coercion to try to tilt the scale in its favour . 
CSC ' s own studies show that about one - third of all sex offenders are convicted of a new criminal offence after release . 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great pleasure to speak about Bill C - 284 regarding amending the Criminal Records Act .

It sends a message that the protection of our children is paramount .

The motion is not in conflict with the comments made by the secretary of state . 
We need strong involvement from across society because we all have a stake in ensuring that Canada ' s children get off to the best possible start in life . 
Motion M - 26 l should go further . 
Could I have unanimous consent of the House to rise in debate to move an amendment to the motion ? 
I suppose what is most frustrating , though , would be for them to witness this last vote . 
This problem dates back to the beginnings of Confederation , worsening as the provinces began to develop programs to meet the growing needs of their populations in the areas of health , education and welfare . 
If this legislation is adopted we will add an additional $ 400 million for the next three years to the combined budgets of these three councils . 
The fact is , these students cannot afford huge increases in the cost of obtaining their education . 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate my good friend Dr. Russell McDonald of Oxford county on his being named an honorary director for life of the royal agricultural winter fair . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
Liar . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Will the Prime Minister and the MPs have a slide show so that we can all benefit collectively from their experience ? 
That kind of behaviour is not going to be allowed in the Canadian forces . 
It is a way of democratizing this place and making our roles more meaningful on a very important issue that will face the Canadian population in the fall . 
The total termination costs include a $ 68 million settlement reached earlier with Loral , the project ' s other prime contractor and the $ 21.2 million settlement with E . H . Industries . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
That was money the provinces needed and counted on to ensure that their people would receive adequate programming in areas such as health and education . 
Why would you be opposed to that ? 
He makes $ 17,000 a year which is his total income . 
Mr. Speaker , it is unfortunate , but I am not delighted to rise today in this House to speak to Bill C - 36 . 
The first of these messages is that , with these millennium scholarships , the federal government is revealing its complete lack of familiarity with Quebec ' s reality . 
We are opposed to this unspeakable intrusion of the federal government in an area that is exclusively under Quebec ' s and the other provinces ' jurisdiction . 
It really has not done much at all , except that when a little bit of heat gets put on a whole bunch of issues it calls time allocation so nobody can really speak in detail to the bill . 
They know they are being taxed to death to supply nothing . 
It can leave its mark everywhere , so long as the students get help . 
( 2 ) The council shall , within six months after the end of each fiscal year , prepare an annual report in respect of the taxes referred to in subsection ( 1 ) that were collected and expended in that year which shall include 
Motion No. 97 
I address myself to the whip of the New Democratic Party . 
Mr. Speaker , members of my party will vote yea . 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion ? 
[ Editor ' s Note : 
Mr. Speaker , the members of the Bloc Quebecois are against this motion . 
The Speaker : 
Ms. Paddy Torsney 
Mr. Michel Gauthier 
Ms. Louise Hardy 
A 63 - year old Kelowna man sexually assaulted his niece and received a conditional sentence . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to comment on the opposition from the Bloc in Quebec . 
Some hon. members : 
The best way to fight crime is to ensure that crime is not committed. 
Obviously , people cannot agree or be pleased with what is going on , particularly when they see individuals such as Lagana and others like him , major drug dealers and big time money launderers - according to the media , and this seems to be confirmed in the legal files - released after serving only one - sixth of their sentence . 
What about the presumption of innocence ? 
We do not see a commitment to funding for such initiatives . 
What would we do in that area ? 
This program supports the implementation of hundreds of local projects promoting the development of children at risk . 
Had we had the co - operation of the parties - and I know the Reform Party agreed but the Bloc reneged on its commitment - Clifford Olson would never have been able to have a section 745 hearing . 
I will not go into detail . 
He pretended that it was a problem of interpretation by the courts and to assist them he again tinkered with the legislation . 
It is clear that Canadians want a youth justice system that protects society . 
Mr. Dick Harris : 
They should be tarred for the rest of their life , instead of working with those young people to help educate them , to help teach them that violence is not a solution . 
This kind of sickness exists in the government . 
Canadians are on the hook and in the dark . 
That might not seem like a lot of money to the Liberal MPs who recently spent that amount of taxpayer money for each night they stayed in a posh Italian hotel , but to this woman it means the difference between paying her suppliers and putting food on the table for her family . 
Mr. Speaker , eligibility criteria for employment insurance may be tougher for young people . 
Does the justice minister believe it is justifiable to slough off all these statistics and this situation until next fall ? 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Health told the House yesterday that albumin blood product meets safety standards not only in the United States but in Canada . 
As I said yesterday , I heard the word , but I did not know who said it . 
This provision has been applied quite liberally . 
I would like to highlight Alberta as well . 
That is the long and short of it . 
Mr. Keith Martin : 
It is another attempt on his part and on the part of the Reform Party to smear judges . 
We have to divorce the perceptions from the realities . 
It is a very inexpensive thing to do . 
Madam Speaker , I would like my colleague ' s opinion on the defence of provocation . 
The best source of income they know is to continue pushing drugs . 
In my opinion , the courts have done well to focus on the fact that these offences do not generally lend themselves to conditional sentences , excepting in extenuating circumstances having to do with such things as the advanced age of the offender , and the severity of his mental or physical condition . 
We all know of the damage done to our society by the sale of drugs . 
Mr. Speaker , I am here tonight to speak on the hepatitis C compensation package . 
Where is the Minister of Health while people are dying ? 
Mr. Grant Hill 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
I feel that the government has an obligation to defend its stated position on the definition of spouse and if an appeal fails then this issue should be put before parliament . 
He spearheaded the effort to rebuild Canada ' s infrastructure and provided $ 2 billion in federal money . 
And the government has been able to do all this because it has dipped into the pockets of the most disadvantaged members of society . 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Eug è ne Bellemare ( Carleton - Gloucester , Lib . ) : 
Finally , the leader of the NDP , Howard Hampton - 
I quote from a document entitled " Speaking Points for the Deputy Minister '' : 
The petitioners are again from Kamloops . 
Bill C - 36 addresses the problem of youth unemployment by giving an EI premium holiday to employers who hire additional young Canadians between the ages of 18 and 24 in the years 1999 and 2000 . 
We are extraordinarily disappointed in how the government has dealt with this whole issue . 
There is a very important principle here . 
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to do so . 
" Bill C - 36 , An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 24 , 1998 , be not now read a third time but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Finance for the purpose of reconsidering Clauses 2 to 46 creating the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation . " 
The millennium scholarship project has also been opposed recently by students . 
YEAS 
In the case of gasoline pricing and profit margins for both big and small players everyone is being hurt by excessive taxes . 
In effect we would be shackling the marketplace with a central command approach to economic questions . 
When the independents are gone they will be gone forever . 
Is the minister unaware of what these people do as a job ? 
Motions in Amendment 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Bill C - 26 . 
CRIMINAL CODE 
For this reason I support the motion . 
If we had had the same documents as you , five members of the Bloc Quebecois would have risen to call for a vote on Motion No. 2 . 
It penalizes those people for the government to make them pay for freedom of movement because of their proximity to a national park and because they will have all kinds of tourists driving by their doorsteps which sometimes has economic benefits and sometimes has drawbacks , in particular in terms of highway traffic and congestion . 
I do not know where they would come from but in order to live up to this clause in the bill they might have to import a contractor from outside the province altogether . 
But no , they are going to insert this wordy clause that means nothing and is , as I have said , trite law . 
Why did they not say for greater clarity in the case of first degree murder that might occur in this park area we had better have a clause saying the Criminal Code applies ? 
In their usual meaning , the words " on behalf of " refer to the idea that one party is undertaking to do something for the benefit and as a representative of another party , generally at the request of the latter : " Behalf : 1 in the interest of ( a person , principle , etc. ) . 
For example , it will provide greater legal certainty regarding the grandfathering of Northwest Territories laws and public institutions in Nunavut . 
A Senate accountable to the voters of Saskatchewan or of P.E.I. , not the Prime Minister , would allow those senators to have a strengthened role in the upper place to review legislation and to have a serious sober second thought on legislation . 
The origin of that part of the country and the history of its division into distinct territories go back a long way . 
The Inuit ratified the agreement with a vote in November 1992 with 85 % of the people voting in favour of the settlement . 
Bill C - 26 is proof of our commitment to rural Canada . 
Both these recommendations make good sense to our caucus . 
The transitional jobs fund is a three year , $ 300 million initiative that works in partnership with private sector employers , communities , workers and other levels of government to create much needed long term jobs for Canadians living in high unemployment areas . 
Apart from being artistic director of the Th éâ tre Sortie de secours since its foundation in 1989 , he has worked with Robert Lepage , which gave him the opportunity to meet artists from various countries . 
So , that is $ 2.7 billion from the employment insurance fund . 
* * * 
Mr. Yvon Godin ( Acadie - Bathurst , NDP ) : 
We have allocated $ 60 million more to energy efficiency and renewals . 
Ms. Marlene Catterall : 
Government cannot unilaterally establish a target . 
The provinces did , however , manage to reach agreement on a minimum position for reductions . 
A high proportion of our gross domestic product is exported. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Report stage 
What would they think of this ? 
The greatest impact of this motion would be to increase tax assistance accorded to donations that would have been made in any case . 
This tax assistance is reduced incrementally to the point of zero when political contributions exceed $ 1,150 per contributor per year . 
Its duty is to ensure that wealth is adequately distributed. 
It is estimated that only one out of four young workers between the ages of 20 and 24 qualifies for employment insurance benefits . 
What about seasonal workers ? 
We would have to start running deficits once again . 
Now , they have the nerve to come and tell the public " We are lowering the debt '' . 
In some regions of Canada they are on welfare . 
To Victoriaville , where everything has been centralized for the summer season . 
Mr. Wayne Easter ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , this past weekend London , Ontario played host to the best example of democracy in Canada , a Reform Party assembly . 
Mr. Speaker , this contract is unique all right . 
Mr. Speaker , today ' s hepatitis C negotiations in Edmonton will be a complete waste of time unless the federal government puts money on the table . 
Mr. Speaker , we hear many biased views about the impact of the reform on seasonal workers , but there are also things the other side of the House never wants to talk about . 
Dear colleagues , I am sure that we all want to hear the answer . 
Ms. Susan Whelan ( Essex , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the member is quite right . 
I believe the Minister of Human Resources misled the House when he spoke of the transitional jobs fund . 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) : 
The minister has knowingly misled the House on three points , which I have just mentioned. 
Without getting into it in some detail , I had a discussion with front line workers in my local Canada employment office on Friday . 
I do not really consider employment insurance to be a social program . 
One , they are collecting too much money to even reasonably be able to pay it out . 
We will never see it coming back . 
Students and some self - employed Canadians have no ability to collect on the fund . 
When the government took office in 1993 , it recognized that the key to a prosperous future for Canadians was getting Canada ' s books in order . 
It is now that the government through the fiscal dividend is able to share , in particular in health care . 
- castigate the government for the catastrophic effects of its reforms to unemployment insurance - 
We had to look at each program and deal with each program . 
The Speaker :

PRIVATE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS 
It is shorter than it was a week ago . 
So , if changes are required to clarify thinking or the scope the committee wishes to give this amendment , if it agrees to it , naturally , I have no problem . 
As far as I know , I am the only person who voted against the amendment . 
It rejected our amendment , even though the arguments used to justify its decision did not convince me at all . 
I know it will raise the hackles of the constituents in my riding . 
Mr. Speaker , I find that an interesting analogy . 
The freshwater system in Canada , particularly the Great Lakes , is one that has over the last five or ten years suffered a fair amount of change because of the zebra mussel being brought into Canada in the bilge water dumpings from foreign vessels . 
The justice minister saw that these people had put this piece buffoonery into the legislation . 
My colleague and others in the House have mentioned that it is a sham to charge the same fees for all people . 
Mr. Speaker , I know that the member ' s constituents are aware of the fact that as mayor of Dauphin , Manitoba he worked very hard on this issue . 
Lo and behold in their senior years the very park they built is closed to them because they cannot afford to go there . 
Not long ago , we inherited from the previous government a deficit that was a staggering $ 42 billion . 
It bypassed the rules on public disclosure of sole source contracts . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien : 
The problem is that whatever government it was in the 1980 s or the 1990 s we see the same problem , that they are irresponsible . 
We have implants . 
From there he launched his career as an independent insurance adjuster . 
The auditor general will be able to audit the agency at his discretion . 
They very much want to work for the parks because they have a talent . 
It failed to confirm in constitutional terms the right to make laws where they are fully vested in either parliament or provincial legislatures . 
That is illegal and they should be dealt with accordingly but the lesson behind that is that these people now have the ability , albeit illegally , to take care of themselves . 
Way , way back when Mr. Diefenbaker was prime minister it was put into law . 
The country was created by people being given help by the government to get started. 
I criticized the leader of the official opposition at the time , and still do , for speaking for two hours on Senate reform without ever saying the word " Inuit " once . 
I think it is time to allow a bit of common sense to enter the debate . 
This has been a personal project of mine since 1996 . 
Being greatly exhausted , he dove out of the fight to regain our lines but was met by another formation which attacked and endeavoured to cut him off . 
I will digress for a minute . 
An hon. member : 
The Immigration Act provides for the removal from Canada of any foreign national found guilty of serious criminal activity . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal 
Just like K - Tel records , Reform is offering free giveaways to entice Canadians to join the party . 
Why does the Prime Minister not back up his claims that this is a great thing by tabling in the House the documents , not excuses , that will prove his point ? 
Mr. Speaker , federal government offices in Newfoundland and Labrador from Port au Bras to St. Anthony are shut down today by protesting fishermen and fish plant workers . 
Yesterday he was convicted of bribes of more than $ 200,000 to influence Senate decision making . 
The minister said in Calgary on May 20 we should be embarrassed by this announcement . 
The TJF is a very successful program for which we have leveraged a lot of private - 
Mr. Gerry Ritz ( Battlefords - Lloydminster , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I would suggest that this Motion for the Production of Papers be transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97 ( 1 ) . 
If members look at the list of people waiting to be judges , they will agree with me that all of them feel that a salary of $ 165,000 to $ 210,000 is sufficient . 
She said there are committees in place and there is wide consultation . 
We have heard previous speakers address this particular clause because it is controversial. 
That is what they have done . 
As the member for Thornhill I feel it is not only in the public interest but in the interest of my constituents in Thornhill . 
More important is a totally different issue . 
More specifically Bill C - 366 is dedicated to the mechanics or technicians who assemble , maintain and repair the cars , trucks , heavy equipment , recreation equipment , airplanes , trains and items of convenience which add so much to enriching our lives every day . 
I noticed in his opening remarks the hon. member was somewhat partisan , but I assure him we want to ensure the issue is dealt with in the most effective way , one that would reduce complexity , ensure efficiency and be in the best interest of the taxpayers , the government and the particular sectors that may be affected by it . 
They have already been dealt with by legislation and can write off their equipment . 
I thank them all for their comments . 
They start doing the work of people such as electricians , pipe fitters and millwrights . 
They were evaluated.

HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Two inspectors in Ontario provide four to five days per company to verify the national pollutant release inventory , a new international compliance . 
At least then we could have some kind of screening process to make sure that irresponsible , ideologically driven , radical judges like Rosalie Abella do not find their way on to the bench . 
It should be nurtured. 
Clause 5 has to do with pay increases for judges . 
Motion No. 2 gives the appropriate committee , which is the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights , an opportunity to review the commission ' s report , call witnesses , examine the commission ' s report and report its findings to the House . 
Things should be brought into this place to let us debate the definition of spouse . 
Those laws should be made here in the House , certainly not in the Supreme Court of Canada . 
Before the legislation is put in place there would be a further opportunity for scrutiny on some of the detail . 
The report need not be tabled at committee . 
Theoretically the government does not actually have to obey the order . 
I am sure members will agree this non - existent fund for a rainy day rates a place with the best fairy tales of our time .

Hon. David M. Collenette ( Minister of Transport , Lib . ) :

Hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
We also led at the OAS just this last week and we will be attending meetings next week . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to continue a little further than my colleague , the House leader for the New Democratic Party . 
Let us look at what we had to give up to get this plan . 
With the DNA warrant legislation firmly in place , the government is proceeding to the next step of its DNA initiative , creating a framework for storing DNA samples and using stored DNA information in the investigation of serious criminal offences . 
This includes strengthening our law enforcement agencies by providing them with the latest technological tools to quickly detect and apprehend the perpetrators of the most violent crimes committed in our society . 
While opinions differed , I would say even very significantly at times , discussions were always courteous . 
The committee ' s own motion that was passed on a special motion is three members with one opposition member and there are no opposition members present . 
This year he caught $ 40,000 worth of fish , gross . 
Fishermen not only want that for themselves , they want it for their children and their grandchildren . 
Except that it is not the fault of the non native fishers and it is not up to them today to pay for everything . 
The opposition members moved to have Brian Tobin , the premier of the province of Newfoundland , testify because he is an expert in this field . 
What is he going to do with the $ 2 million , the $ 2.5 million left unused in his program ? 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
Mr. Mark Muise 
There is no need to have bills introduced directly in the Senate . 
It is what Canadians rely on to protect them and their environment from accidents on the rails and waterways and in the the skies and the pipelines of this country . 
Who was affected by it ? 
Shame on the Liberals for allowing the Senate to continue its downward slide . 
To conduct the survey , EGALE obtained the co - operation of the Department of Justice and the Canadian Human Rights Commission and two of is prominent analysts , Stephen Samis and Sandra Goundry . 
I am thinking about the certificate for danger of the public . 
The hon. member will address his remarks to the Chair and not to the minister . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) : 
As he may have noticed , I presented the responses to no less than 40 petitions today and we have over 1,000 petitions to deal with . 
No contributions have been made to the plan by the employer since December 31 , 1984 and by employees since December 31 , 1991 . 
Those companies may not be individuals but corporations . 
The government has no legislative vision . 
Let us not kid ourselves , these are tough guys who fear nothing , especially not a guard who is asking them to go back to their cell because it is late . 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett 
Hon. Hedy Fry 
Mr. Ken Epp 
Mr. Mike Scott 
Much work has already been done in this field . 
Perhaps the proposed commissioner ' s office could be assigned the responsibility to lobby and co - ordinate toward common benefits right across the country . 
Madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
I am very concerned as are many of the members of our party . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
The leader of the Conservative Party was quoted in 1994 as saying that protecting gay men and lesbians from discrimination is too costly for taxpayers . 
It is talking about not distinguishing one sexual preference from another in the legislation . 
If the attorney general fails to act then the Rosenberg decision will likely set a precedent which will have a domino effect on over 40 pieces of legislation , all of which will strike at the heart of the definition of spouse and the definition of marriage in Canadian law . 
The hon. leader of the fifth party said that it is reasonable for this parliament to discriminate in terms of the definition of marriage ; to discriminate positively and justifiably in favour of marriage conceived as it has been throughout the millennia as an institution consisting of members of opposite sexes . 
* * * 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
However , let us not forget that health is a shared jurisdiction between the federal government and the provinces . 
How does the Minister of Health expect to maintain any credibility with such nonsense , when transfer payments , which were $ 678 per person - 
Could the minister tell us more about the nature and purpose of the investments to be made under the plan ? 
I would be very pleased to receive additional information to be able to give a more elaborate response to my hon. colleague as soon as possible . 
ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS ( REMEDIAL AND DISCIPLINARY MEASURES ) ACT 
We have heard the saying that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . 
I am here to speak for myself in this debate on the motion brought forward . 
How do I dare say such a thing ? 
I will quote the current health minister when he was the justice minister . 
Let us live with tolerance and encourage citizens who are willing to work and live together to create constructive social units in our cities and in our rural areas and make real contributions to the country . 
The Canadian people do not trust the Reform Party to protect basic human rights for good reason . 
Society at large will be subject to the whims of a handful of individuals meeting in private and handing down decisions without ever having to justify themselves or those decisions . 
A government that refuses to tackle this difficult task while in office is just not doing its job . 
As I see it , the courts and legislatures are still engaged in a constructive dialogue in this area of the charter . 
We all know that the interests of the people who the Bloc purports to represent are different than the interests of the majority in this place . 
We can allow judges to interpret the law given their best judgment . 
Why the flip - flop ? 
When they are willing to engage in open and honest debate the House should listen , but for the motion the only response possible is to send it to defeat .

They come right from the department of Indian affairs , lest anyone think I am making them up . 
Some hon. members : 
The official opposition is not present in the Senate . 
Some hon. members : 
How are we going to handle that to help us to bring us together as a country yet not cause division between provinces like we have had too often over the last few years ? 
However , over the years we have raised some serious doubts about that very point right here as members of the opposition . 
It is at times like this that I really miss the ability to use visual aids after my 31 years of teaching . 
All of a sudden farmers realized they can market their wheat and barley the same as they are marketing canola , flax , lentils and peas and get better prices . 
They always say a government is not elected ; a government is defeated. 
We fundamentally believe that the future of the wheat board is a debate for farmers and not for corporations . 
In some cases with the legislation it would exacerbate the problems of western Canadian producers , particularly with a very objectionable clause that was put in by one of the members of government . 
We know there is sensitive trading information that , if it were made available , it would have a deleterious effect on the wheat board ' s ability to trade in an open market . 
If the advisory board members did such a good job , why not elect all 15 directors instead of appointing five ? 
Mr. Jean - Paul Marchand 
Mr. Grant Hill 
Mr. Jack Ramsay 
The Speaker : 
Somehow we in opposition have to show the frustration and that is all . 
My hon. colleague has been saying a lot of things that are exactly true and right . 
There are rules by which we govern ourselves in our standing orders and in Beauchesne ' s . 
A proper functioning democracy needs an efficient opposition . 
Mr. Denis Coderre : 
I will give them numbers . 
Just recently , the members of his party voted against compensating some of the victims of hepatitis C . Is he proud of his government for that ? 
It was debated and voted on and it was carried unanimously in this House , that the government would take steps to enact a victims bill of rights . 
Mr. Jim Pankiw : 
Mr. Speaker , I too have a great many petitions to present concerning the multilateral agreement on investment . 
Four hundred thousand low income Canadians will be taken off the income tax roles entirely . 
It is this government that has done that . 
There are more officers working on this file than before and to what end ? 
Mr. John Williams ( St. Albert , Ref. ) : 
All the world ' s major religions offer some form of the golden rule . 
Now it comes out that the Prime Minister thinks these victims are no more deserving of government compensation than cigarette addicts or junkies on illegal drugs . 
We have accepted our responsibility and we were the ones to take the initiative to compensate and the provinces did not want to do anything at that time . 
Is the minister prepared to go to Vancouver , hold a town hall meeting and tell the people who show up there that the city belongs to aboriginals ? 
Mr. Speaker , according to a recent consultant ' s report Canada ' s health protection branch is in a crisis . 
Personally , I would prefer not to see members launching these sorts of attacks because sometimes we do not have all the facts . 
Since the objective of the Young Offenders Act is reintegration into society , I would have thought the province best applying the act would get more money , but the opposite is true . 
This is cause for great concern . 
Fearmongering is also part of Reform ' s strategy . 
My question is on the record and her non - answer is on the record . 
Those members just do not get it . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Madam Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague from Frontenac - M é gantic for his important questions . 
At the same time , there are cuts to health , forced hospital bed closings , cuts to transfer payments to the provinces , and a surplus of $ 20 billion in the employment insurance fund . 
That is not what this government did. 
There is no justice in this country . 
There is not unanimous consent . 
Family violence is not limited to the poor . 
This is unacceptable . 
He was murdered while under an arm of the justice system in Canada . 
This is all about a gun registry , not gun control .

Mr. Charlie Penson 
Concurrence in Vote 1 - Agriculture and Agri - Food 
Concurrence in Vote 100 - Industry 
Is there unanimous consent ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased actually to debate this motion . 
We did not come here to face the other side with all the seats empty . 
Anything that comes out today from what the Reform Party did last night that helps the government see more clearly and to get its act together will be of benefit to all of us . 
It was a bit of irony to see the reaction of the government House leader when this occurred , a complete overreaction I would suggest , an attitude of disbelief that the opposition would have the audacity to stand up and oppose what was about to happen . 
He is not as new as I am , but I always respect and enjoy hearing the hon. member speak . 
There is a period for questions and comments at the end when members are encouraged to make comments and ask questions , and argue with the hon. member . 
We look after the public interest . 
When we have one member there , we have 100 % of our membership on that committee present . 
Ms. Marlene Catterall ( Ottawa West - Nepean , Lib . ) : 
Some hon. members : 
That Vote 1 , in the amount of $ 193,805,000 , under JUSTICE - Department - Operating expenditures , in the Main Estimates for the fiscal year ending March 31 , 1999 ( less the amount voted in Interim Supply ) , be concurred in . 
I remember very distinctly a lot of literature coming from the Liberal camp , and from my Liberal opponent , which said that it was impossible to balance the budget in three years . 
I certainly question the wisdom of that . 
Why was this government re - elected ? 
Schizophrenia causes acute suffering , increased homelessness and chronic unemployment . 
One wonders why Mr. Bouchard is wasting everyone ' s time with his phoney commission , whose mandate is to torpedo the efforts of those who dare work to improve Canada ' s future . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
But when it comes to the HIV strategy to help those with AIDS , even those who got HIV through the blood system , the Reformers will not support it . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
First we have the Reform who opposes the Nisga ' a agreement in principle . 
It recommended that a committee be set up to monitor and review the estimates and the supply process . 
An hon. member : 
If the hon. member could work the Department of Justice into her intervention , it would make it much more relevant to the debate at hand . 
Can the minister tell us a little about what her government plans to do with respect to the Canadian Human Rights Act ? 
Look at the polls . 
Mr. Speaker , many witnesses who testified at the standing committee on justice with regard to firearms registration said many times that a registry of firearms is certainly not going to prevent crime in any substantive way . 
I had a lot of good feedback from the Reform members of how impressed they were with our community . 
Although at that time the question also concerned Quebec sovereignty , another consultation was held after 1992 , again in accordance with the Quebec referendum legislation . 
Mr. Speaker , we can indeed talk about justice in general. 
Their solution to providing justice in this country is to change the way the government works in terms of the relationship with the provinces and municipalities . 
I think the Canadian people have spoken very clearly on that issue . 
I am not prepared to say that the increase in the poverty rate will help , because when people are poor and have nothing to eat , they will perhaps rob the corner store . 
I will try to relate to how much society and government resources are committed to the area of justice and then relate that to our lack of satisfaction . 
Anything we as a society , anything we as a government , anything we as a country can do to ensure there are not firearms on the streets in whatever form will make our society a safer place . 
Mr. Bill Casey : 
Hon. Don Boudria : 
All of these issues were mentioned. 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
That means this government is working properly . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis ( Scarborough - Agincourt , Lib . ) : 
Canadians will continue to lose confidence and have contempt for this institution . 
We have two penitentiary systems . 
I cut off the hon. member for York South - Weston in his reply because in my view it was not relevant to the debate before us . 
We have too many more important things to do . 
Why is he against the initiatives of the government which deal with the protection of our society and with the prevention of crimes in our society ? 
It is saying that moving tolerance to .05 will not work either . 
Agreed.

MOTIONS FOR PAPERS 
[ Editor ' s Note : 
Canadian research centres across the country have made progress extending the life expectancy of those diagnosed with leukemia . 
Mr. Michel Gauthier ( Roberval , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the health minister says the facts were wrong in this report . 
Does the Prime Minister intend to ask the new ombudsman to give priority to this case so that the minister may take vigorous sanctions against these sexual predators in order to put an end - 
General Abubakar could start by releasing Chief Abiola who is now coming up to his fifth year in prison . 
Mr. Reed Elley ( Nanaimo - Cowichan , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , it is my pleasure to present to the House a petition signed by Bramptonians in the region of Peel , which is signed by over 500 Canadians . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to bring to your attention Question No. 92 which is now past due . 
A commanding officer may make final decisions concerning not only minor offences , but also serious and sensitive offences that may implicate interests well beyond his or her individual unit . 
A situation is taking place in our military that is tearing out its guts . 
The position of independent inspector general has been completely left out . 
Being charged with obstruction of justice should not depend on where one is positioned in the national defence hierarchy . 
We want the public to know that the military serves it and not itself . 
The main focus of this bill and a key focus of the act is the military justice system , the distinct system of penal law applicable to members of the Canadian forces and other persons subject to Canadian military jurisdiction . 
For a number of years , he worked for a group well known to all parliamentarians , the Company of Young Canadians , to which he gave distinguished service . 
It will be business and it will be fair and square and above board at all times . 
People would speak who have worked on the issue , are knowledgeable about the issue . 
The defence minister and the foreign minister accept parliament ' s interest , all parties ' interest in the engagement of our foreign troops . 
The Reform Party has no faith in Canada ' s institutions , including the institution of the prime minister . 
It is a legitimate concern on the part of a great many people that it is not just any industry , that it is the nuclear industry . 
I thank the hon. member for his comments . 
We are all agreed on this side of the House that we are about to make the correct move in the person we are putting forward as the new access to information commissioner . 
It means " people of the dawn " or " those the furthest east '' . 
I wish to thank my colleague from Halifax West , who is here today , for understanding its impact and supporting it in the House . 
In the 20 th century , the countless formal education techniques utilized to integrate and assimilate the Mi ' kmaq students have met with failure , because these techniques have ignored the culture , the language , the history and philosophy of our people . 
There was not this bitter attitude that seems to creep into this place all the time . 
As to whether or not the current system has worked , in places it does and in places it does not . 
I could go on to talk about some recommendations that the Senate made in addition to these amendments , but I do not have the time . 
I have said many times that without question the Canadian Wheat Board is an agency that is respected around the world . 
Mr. Wayne Easter : 
The inclusion clause was one of the few redeeming features of Bill C - 4 and it has now been gutted. 
I guarantee the fellow from Sherwood did not know the first thing about a wheat board like most members on that side . 
I think that may be preferred over the drunken brawling group we have over there this evening . 
They are well able to hold it accountable . 
That stubborn farmer from western Canada does not give up so easy . 
The RCMP cannot touch it . 
Bill C - 48 . 
Motion agreed to 
Mr. John Richardson 
Mr. David Chatters 
PETITIONS 
That Bill C - 38 , in Clause 1 , be amendedby replacing line 8 on page 1 with the following : 
The Tuktut Nogait National Park , also known as the Bluenose National Park , should include the Nunavut settlement region and the Sahtu Dene settlement region , which is another 12,000 square kilometres of park . 
That is why I bring to the House ' s attention that it is only 20 % and it is important to understand that . 
This situation is even more unacceptable when we consider that it has a particular impact on women judges who constitute the majority of those appointed at an early age . 
An additional Citizen article on the same date also revealed that more and more two parent families had two parents in the workforce in 1996 while at the same time the number of children left at home was increasing . 
This bill does not intervene . 
Despite the salary freeze of recent years , the federal courts have excellent magistrates at this time . 
Were it not for other aspects of this bill , my party would support it . 
Unfortunately , because the bill has not gone as far as I would like it to , we cannot support it . 
We in this House have bad days too . 
Mr. Peter MacKay : 
On that basis , as a member of parliament , I would have fully rejected the proposal. 
Division No. 217 
PAIRED 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi ( Bramalea - Gore - Malton , Lib . ) : 
The building that houses the Quebec Department of Justice will now be called Louis - Philippe Pigeon . 
Mr. Speaker , the government thinks it has a dozen ways to wash these stains from its hands . 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party . 
If this is the way the ranks deal with information , I wonder how this ombudsman appointment is going to help fix things up in any way . 
Mr. Speaker , I absolutely deny what the hon. member is saying . 
I have had the opportunity on several occasions to discuss this matter with Mrs. Harel , and I can state that we were the first government to act in this matter , which we have been following very closely , by making close to $ 3 million available to the former BC mine workers , specifically in order to provide them with as much assistance as possible in terms of training and active measures . 
Some hon. members : 
This may be called a severance , but it is clearly the alternative pension plan we have insisted upon since 1989 . 
There is no good time to do this . 
It was not clear as to whether there was a provision for interest should a person for instance who has opted of the pension system leave at age 51 . 
Otherwise it would not be very logical and I would be quickly reminded of that not only by people opposite in this House , but also by the media and by the public generally . 
Agreed. 
As one of my colleagues said we have another situation where we have severance which will ultimately end up in an RRSP . 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows : 
In conjunction with the issue of the flooding in northern Alberta I asked this House through private member ' s Motion No. 11 to provide the same kind of disaster relief for the farmers whose property and farms were destroyed in the flooding simply to give those farmers the same level of disaster relief that farmers in Ontario and Quebec were granted because of the ice storm and the flooding . 
Members will recall that there was a serious drought in Saskatchewan at that time and indeed some action was needed. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard - Bujold ( Jonqui è re , BQ ) :

Mr. Ted McWhinney 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
Shall clause 9 carry ? 
The Assistant Deputy Chairman : 
Madam Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Bill S - 2 is the result of these changes suggested by both the Dryden investigation and by the Canadian Transportation Board Accident Investigation and Safety Board Review Commission . 
We will derive more in the future if we can preserve these species for the benefit of all , not to mention the philosophical benefits of being able to give to our children what we have received from our parents .

They only talk but nothing has been done . 
The hon. member for Verch è res now has the floor . 
Hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
I am here to tell you that this is not the case . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister appointed five new senators yesterday , including the former president of the Liberal Party ' s Judy LaMarsh fund and a former special assistant to the Liberal Minister of Finance . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Agreed. 
That sustainable development or that non - parasitic way of utilizing the land and resources for our own immediate needs without putting back is a crucial lesson for future generations . 
But why not start out correctly from the very beginning ? 
But I am talking about general usage . 
Mr. Walt Lastewka 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. Gar Knutson 
We would not argue with that . 
They are made for a variety of purposes and in accordance with a variety of different terms and conditions . 
Charities on the other hand do not fit that definition . 
That is wrong . 
When this bill was brought forward , the intention was to have it completed before the summer recess . 
But today in the next 10 minutes I will be kind to it . 
That is preferable because it just provides much more flexibility in dealing with those types of cases . 
Motions Nos. 4 , 5 , 7 and 8 of Group No. 2 would expand this framework to include Internet communication . 
Motion No. 6 
Madam Speaker , we are debating Bill C - 20 , an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequent and related amendments to others acts . 
And more than five members having risen : 
Mr. Peter Goldring ( Edmonton East , Ref. ) : 
I would call upon the Government of Canada to express its displeasure at this fundamental breach of human rights in the same manner as it expressed its displeasure at the detonation of the bomb . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
This would amount to approximately $ 25,000,000 per year . 
( g ) Each year , about 400 clients fail to report the death of a CTB , child tax benefit , entitled child to Revenue Canada , and continue to reveive benefits in respect of that child for an extended period of time , i . e . , more that a year following the death of the child . 
Immigration headquarters has the responsability for researching the human rights record of regimes in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade , DFAIT . 
Commanders must maintain the standards at all times to reinforce these characteristics for peace and war . 
The court decision on the challenge of Bill C - 68 is due any day and it is widely expected that it will rule in favour of the province . 
I appreciate the intent of the amendment put forward by the hon. member from the Bloc. 
Just six weeks later , on January 2 , 1981 , Olson was charged with rape , buggery , and other sexual offences and weapons offences in relation to an offence that undoubtedly would have ended in murder had the victim not escaped. 
Mr. Speaker , I have not had the opportunity to be that close to debate on the bill , although I have certainly been aware of it . 
Before allowing questions and comments , it is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Acadie - Bathurst , National Defence ; the hon. member for Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , Employment insurance . 
Mr. Peter MacKay ( Pictou - Antigonish - Guysborough , PC ) : 
What he has said has been so utterly reasonable that I do not think even an unreasonable Liberal would want to refuse to listen to the argument . 
I also would like to say something regarding the concerns with respect to the invasion of the privacy of the criminal. 
Privacy interests protected by the charter of rights and freedoms relate to a reasonable expectation of privacy and not privacy at large . 
This is a needlessly restrictive use of DNA in Bill C - 3 . 
As a bit of an aside , it took us 25 to 30 minutes to get through security . 
What we are really looking to protect is the privacy of an individual who may have committed a heinous crime as opposed to the security and safety of Canadian citizens . 
( The House adjourned at 6:55 p.m. ) 
Mr. Chuck Strahl 
APEC SUMMIT 
Therefore , they request parliament to repeal Bill C - 68 , the Firearms Act , and spend their hard earned tax dollars on more cost effective , crime fighting measures such as hiring more police to fight organized crime and more crime prevention programs . 
However , that fact may not be readily apparent to those who are trying to socially re - engineer Canadians . 
I do not think anyone doubts our commitment to it but more needs to be done . 
The cost of the consequences for the improper use of firearms in Canada has been estimated at $ 6.6 billion per year . 
Today , however , we are well past that situation . 
I think it should be of major concern to this member here that the people of Canada cannot express themselves and let their will be known . 
It would be far better to say that everything it does it means to be right but sometimes it will have to make some changes along the way . 
We will be voting freely on this motion before the House . 
Handgun permits were only issued to certified gun collectors and sports club members who were taking part in shooting competitions . 
Today a majority of gun owners support gun control . 
The licensing of firearms users is one of the central features of this legislation . 
They want no part of it whatsoever . 
A custodian of premises being searched must co - operate with the inspectors or risk being charged under section 111 with an indictable offence carrying a penalty of up to two years in prison . 
The hon. member for Lac - Saint - Louis . 
One of the items is 10 reasons for the registration of all guns . 
The hon. member mentioned that he was a past police officer and did not see any benefit in the legislation .

I am horrified every time I hear about a child taking firearms to school and using them with deadly consequences on innocent schoolmates . 
Mr. Richard Marceau ( Charlesbourg , BQ ) :

Even the members of the Reform Party agree with that selection . 
However , it is for the reason that Bill C - 68 is going to make our streets less safe that we oppose it . 
CULTURAL POLICY 
Mr. Bill Matthews 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 124 
Through meetings such as these , the importance of protecting and enhancing Canadian and other cultures is brought front and centre on the world stage . 
The rest were not and none of them were pepper sprayed. 
The Speaker : 
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
We are making it very clear to those in the United States that we will take action if they do not fix this situation and bring their people into line . 
It would eliminate one clause in the Canada Post Corporation Act which currently bars a group of employees from free collective bargaining and from their right to form a union . 
Hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Greenpeace Canada , Heart and Stroke Foundation Ontario , Help the Aged , Homemakers magazine , Horizons of Friendship , the Humane Society of Canada , the International Planned Parenthood Federation . 
Wrong again . 
Today , however , the Liberal Party has left these concerns far behind . 
What exactly does telemarketing constitute ? 
We all know that the Liberals are really not good financial managers and that the international community has rendered its judgment on that point , a very negative judgment . 
I ask , for once do what is right and get rid of section 745 . 
Although I may once again appear to be defending the government , my purpose is in fact to see that justice prevails . 
Mr. King came to me prior to that case and shared with me the years of anguish he went through personally as a result of the incident that unfortunately happened to his son . 
She had a very easy explanation to understand and certainly it is why I am a proponent to have this section eliminated. 
Ms. Jean Augustine 
Hon. Paul Martin 
Prayers 
Mr. Beaudry asked Councillor Arnold to withhold two recommendations from a city draft report . 
Right now the words of the statute give the commission the powers to look into complaints , to investigate , to hear evidence and to make public reports . 
This is a public servant with an impeccable record as Canada ' s chief actuary for the last seven years . 
Mr. Speaker , I think it has been well established that ministers do not answer with respect to any regional responsibilities . 
The hon. member simply does not understand how the Canadian system works . 
Mr. Chuck Cadman ( Surrey North , Ref. ) : 
With respect to Canada and Chile , pension and social security payments will be taxable by the country from which the payments are made . 
Mr. Speaker , it is my pleasure to rise to speak to Bill S - 16 . 
Senator Mahovlich put on his new suit on Tuesday , which we know from reading the full page ad in the Globe and Mail was picked out by his personal shopper at Harry Rosen . 
It all depends on the type of relationship and the subsidiaries that will be established in Vietnam by Canadian interests and vice versa . 
That same Len Farber who told us there was no problem with the family trusts condemned by the Bloc Quebecois as well as by the auditor general two and a half years ago . 
As I said before , the tax treaties are between Canada and the Republic of Vietnam , the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Chile . 
It is all part of a very important process that is consistent with our position as a nation in embracing the global opportunities that we have . 
I am afraid that the amendment moved by the hon. member does not deal with the substance of this bill . 
This is an extremely important question , and it deserves an answer . 
We could only wish the Minister of Finance would express the same concern over the cost of administering the GST. 
Surrey is my town and I cannot let that go . 
We will not go into detail . 
That I should be granted that distinction twice in eight years is something that can only be understood as a tribute to the people of South Africa by the Canadian people , to whom we owe so much , and an expression of the partnership between us . 
Mr. President , you have said : 
Hon. Jim Peterson 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott 
Bill C - 35 was designed to allow us to charge non - Canadian businesses for dumping and selling the product in the country for less than it costs to produce . 
They actually thought our Prime Minister was the best thing since sliced bread because we have driven so many investors to the state of Oregon and they have created so many jobs . 
* * * 
Given that our population is below 600,000 people , it is fair to say that Newfoundland has been literally decimated by out - migration since 1986 . 
The Speaker : 
Why did the finance minister allow his department to establish a special committee to gag the chief actuary ? 
It belongs to the workers and employers of this country . 
Political expedience aside , are those premiums going to be reduced ? 
I have two other petitions , Mr. Speaker . 
Be like us . 
Revenue Canada and the Canadian International Trade Tribunal are responsible for administering the system while Revenue Canada is responsible for policy and legislation . 
We ask for one amendment only . 
Why are we providing other countries like the United States with a clear set of rules saying what we will do and how it will work ? 
Could the hon. member explain to this House the differences in approaches by two different members in his party ? 
Some hon. members : 
People are what counts here . 
Again , accessibility has been a fundamental principle of the Canadian student loans program since its inception in 1964 . 
These are startling figures . 
Mr. R é ginald B é lair 
MONTREAL CONGRESS CENTRE 
My prediction is that the government will vote down this motion and not produce the documents with regard to the Calgary Declaration . 
In the last couple of years they have benefited to a hefty sum from the government . 
When all regions of Canada are taken together , 25 % of those polled said yes ; 56 % said no ; and 19 % said they did not know . 
They say " We want the documentation relating to the Calgary declaration '' . 
It would provide authority to create a limited pilot program on a cost recovery basis for capital leasing . 
It can tax people , run it through the bureaucracy and then somehow have a more beneficial effect with that money than if it had just left it in the pockets of Canadian business owners and taxpayers . 
That is the only piece of good news . 
I have to muse at this point as to where this notion of leasing requirement originated. 
I say that for the following reasons . 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion ? 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the people of Sherbrooke have spoken . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Oh , oh . 
Hon. Jane Stewart ( Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
This charge , while separate in itself , does involve other jurisdictions such as the Board of Internal Economy and the Treasury Board . 
I believe the member also alleged that the rules applying to the Board of Internal Economy for the employees of the House of Commons also apply to others who are not employees of the House of Commons . 
DIVORCE ACT 
I invite him to take a look at them because I think they are quite significant . 
The Canadian taxpayers are at their breaking point and someone has to say enough is enough . 
I am also saying that . 
I point out one obvious factor . 
For example , I would like to address some of the main concerns the auditor general has cited in his report . 
My understanding from the Reform Party is that it does not want the bill at all . 
Not only does this government insist on imposing ridiculously high rates , it also raises rates such as the CPP under the auspices of what I mentioned earlier . 
At the request of the chief government whip , the vote is deferred until Tuesday at the conclusion of the time provided for Government Orders . 
Once imposed , the temporary order would bar communication while the accused is held pending the bail hearing . 
JUSTICE 
Mr. Lee Morrison 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to table a petition today from B.C. residents who recognize that registering firearms does nothing to fight violent crime . 
The most important reason the scheme has survived is that it provides for judicial oversight of the collection of DNA samples . 
The record of being tough on crime is not there . 
Bill C - 3 provides therefore that samples will be kept . 
Once we have collected a DNA sample , then a person ' s entire genetic make - up is available for one and all . 
His justification of that is exactly the justification that we make for having the DNA sample taken at the time of charge . 
I have a big concern with this and would like the member to comment on it . 
Mr. Paul DeVillers : 
The danger with extending the legislation as proposed by the opposition to taking samples upon charge is that it would encourage police to go on a fishing expedition . 
I accept , and colleagues all around the House note , that a DNA sample is capable of revealing an awful lot of information about a human being . 
It is worth noting that access to DNA profiles contained in the convicted offenders index and the samples themselves will be strictly limited to those directly involved in the operation of the data bank . 
Mr. Beno î t Serr é ( Timiskaming - Cochrane , Lib . ) : 
There is a debate . 
We want to make sure that the money is used for the interests of the workers . 
We find that there are millions of social insurance cards circulating in Canada with no legitimate owners . 
Miss Deborah Grey ( Edmonton North , Ref. ) : 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis ( Winnipeg North Centre , NDP ) : 
His constituents adored him . 
The victims slip through the cracks . 
It will miss the opportunity of doing something very constructive in allowing our law enforcement people to have another tool to help them in protecting Canadians on a day to day basis . 
It is by the same bunch that sat over here and said they would never do what the Conservatives did when in power . 
The government feels that the taking of DNA should be restricted to very narrow circumstances , such as multiple murderers and people who have committed sexual offences . 
I believe Bill C - 3 is a much stronger bill as a result of the extensive consultation and debate that has taken place . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
In a recent news article the Secretary of State for Children and Youth said " We feel our activities are child centred. 
Clause 1 amends the preamble to the Criminal Records Act by providing for an exception whereby a criminal record may be disclosed where public interest so requires it . 
Many are concerned about ensuring that those responsible for children will not abuse their position of trust . 
Mr. Estey , who is studying all aspects of the grain industry in western Canada , has been asked to recommend ways to ensure Canada has the world ' s most efficient , viable and competitive grain transportation and handling system to meet the ongoing and long term expectations of our customers . 
MCCRAE HOUSE 
Hon. Sergio Marchi 
During his tenure at this Panamanian business Ron was able to effect improvements and cost control by closely monitoring parts procurement and equipment failure diagnosis .

The difference between our position and the position of Reform Party members is that we would like to give the money to the workers , but they want us to give it to the companies . 
The Speaker : 
The Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Trade . 
We will all miss him , and I offer my condolences to the members of his family who are here today . 
Dear colleagues , I wish to address my remarks directly to Lucien Lamoureux ' s children , Michel , Sylvie and Ad è le , who are here today . 
POINTS OF ORDER 
I assure him , as I did the previous member , that I will look into this matter as soon as I possibly can . 
That act would have simply brought in the 90 - 10 rule as a new status quo . 
From the records we find that in 1988 , 10 years ago , Players made a profit of $ 308 million ; in 1997 , 10 years hence , it made $ 775 million . 
Mrs. Pauline Picard ( Drummond , BQ ) : 
This is a product that when used properly , when used as recommended , will kill and injure its users . 
We simply cannot attack advertising or education . 
The population of the receiving province is also a factor . 
When times are tough , when times are bad , equalization payments increase but as a province ' s economic situation improves its equalization entitlements are reduced. 
We need to be aware of this as there is some truth in it . 
Instead of allowing this to proceed and having that revealed for all Canadians to see , the government decided to settle out of court , blame its decision on another ruling having to do with the internal trade agreement between the provinces in Canada and duck altogether the possibility that this terrible weakness in NAFTA would have been revealed. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand 
AIRBUS INVESTIGATION 
Canadians understand that meeting those objectives and rising to those ideals costs money . 
The maritimes are very unenthusiastic because the program to harmonize the sales tax is not producing the expected results , in spite of the fact that this new approach to tax collection has cost Canadian taxpayers over $ 2 billion . 
These are all marvellous motherhood objectives but we have to look closely at whether the bill actually achieves them . 
The judge himself said that Revenue Canada officials had used illegal means to collect the money . 
He told us that there are a couple of important reasons for proposing this legislation . 
Why has the GST not disappeared ? 
Ontario has said no . 
One of the tragedies or one of the losses that we have seen in recent years is that politicians have made gratuitous attacks on public servants without really considering the ramifications of those attacks . 
The minister has consulted widely with Revenue Canada ' s employees . 
However , I note that she did not really address the question I asked about why the government had decided to adopt the agency when it could have achieved the same flexibility through statutory changes . 
The government has not responded positively to this initiative . 
When an agency is given unchecked power , no critique , no bottom line as to who it is accountable to that is a dangerous precedent . 
Why does he think the government is listening when it does not have provinces signing on to this project ? 
No , especially not with a Minister of Finance who does not even care about the real purpose of the employment insurance fund . 
* * * 
* * * 
Does the Prime Minister - who is stubbornly refusing to take any initiative to get the economy back on track - not realize that the outrageous cuts he continues to make in the economy could bring about a recession within a year ? 
He has done a great job . 
Let them understand that they are now swallowing themselves whole . 
* * * 
The agency is a relative of Big Brother , the computer that could run and rule the world . 
Madam Speaker , my question pertains to privatization . 
We look at that kind of measure along the lines of privatization . 
Even if we take that at face value that may be good for governments in terms of huge bureaucracies but there are very real questions about how that does affect individual Canadians who then have to find their way through an increasing maze of a massive bureaucracy , to try to retrieve information , to find out what happened to their income tax return or any other matter that may be before the agency . 
What is wrong with that ? 
Madam Speaker , I would have three brief comments to make . 
Mr. Speaker , I congratulate the hon. member for Prince Albert on his remarks . 
I know the people of Alberta , 92 % of them , are prepared to incur some small cost to be able to hold their representative accountable . 
I want to focus on the words " more effectively and cost efficiently '' . 
One thing we can say is the recent years of government deficit fighting efforts have really hit charities hard . 
In this country it is possible for ordinary Canadians to get elected and to contribute to political parties . 
The proposal is being put forward by the member for Fraser Valley , a member of the Reform Party .

I was recently in an office in Vancouver in connection with my responsibility for regional development . 
While all this is on one side of the government ' s books , it tries to stand in the House and tell us what a wonderful thing this is going to be for small business . 
The Liberals should take immediate action to save these businesses and these jobs .

There is cost recovery under this program . 
At committee stage it is hoped that the amendments which will be put forward by the opposition parties will be listened to logically by the government because , quite frankly , no government has a lock on ideas on how to make legislation better . 
Our productivity was significantly lower than that of the U.S. when our dollar was 90 cents . 
I reached the point where I said I was not going to do it any more . 
It has a research department in advance display technologies . 
Making coins for other nations keeps the mint presses running at high speed and around the clock , which is the most cost effective production technique available . 
I would like to emphasize that and to indicate to the government that the continued use of that statement is really quite inappropriate . 
Mr. John Bryden 
KOSOVO 
Mrs. Pauline Picard 
In 1994 the government estimated that these 553,000 handguns represented about half of all the firearms in the existing firearms registry . 
We fought the election . 
The protection of property rights has long been a recognized and fundamental aspect of social and economic justice . 
That the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister should claim this as a victory for the government rings very hollow when we read that decision . 
Mr. John Bryden ( Wentworth - Burlington , Lib . ) : 
Mrs. Pauline Picard : 
What we are looking for is a relationship between the federal government and the provincial governments that will be progressive , that will be futuristic and that will work in the 21 st century . 
This is much more than an economics issue . 
It was a small starting point. 
The fall of the Canadian dollar may be profitable in the short term for the tourism industry , for example , but it is not profitable in the long run in the high tech sector , in particular in those sectors where inputs have to be bought in the United States , in those sectors where high tech electronic equipment must be bought at higher prices . 
Often these efforts go unnoticed. 
I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the victims . 
Will he voluntarily appear before the commission or will he let Jean Carle be the fall guy for him ? 
The memo further states that all policing overtime and standby is now suspended but it is critical for smaller communities where understaffed detachments have been providing 24 - hour coverage by being on standby . 
Mr. Alex Shepherd ( Durham , Lib . ) : 
Why does not the Reform want to support - 
I wish to draw to the attention of members the presence in the gallery of Dr. Nikolaus Michalek , Federal Minister of Justice of the Republic of Austria and President of the European Union Council for Justice and Home Affairs . 
They ask , in particular , that the government recognize the fundamental rights of individuals to pursue family life free from undue interference of the state , and to recognize the fundamental right , responsibility and liberty of parents to direct the upbringing of their children . 
The Government of Canada has tabled a position and we are respecting the protocol agreed to by all the governments involved in negotiating in public . 
But in these negotiations the Government of Canada has only one bottom line and that is what is good for Canadians and good for Canada . 
We do not want this kind of action . 
Canada stands number one among the nations of the world in this year ' s United Nations human development index . 
In other words , provincial tax revenues increase , federal revenues decrease and the national taxpayer still pays the same rate . 
It makes me proud that the new Canada act introduced by our worthy leader with a true vision of Canada is an alternative that federalists as well as separatists will embrace . 
This federal intervention is seen as a kind of insulting paternalism in Quebec , Alberta and the rest of Canada . 
They realized that the fight against child poverty requires a national effort based on a constructive partnership between the federal government and the provinces and territories . 
It is imperative that we re - examine the Canada Corporations Act and require at least the same level of transparency that exists with for profit corporations or , at the very least , the same level of transparency that exists now with bureaucracies . 
This is something Quebec cannot give up . 
That is a very significant statement which has come from these groups . 
Mr. Jerry Pickard 
APEC SUMMIT 
PRIVILEGE 
The reason is that this government cares less about the public interest and Canada ' s sovereignty than about maintaining comfortable relationships with foreign fishing interests . 
I have a lot of respect for the member opposite . 
One of the sad facts of life is that the resource , the technology of developing nuclear weapons , is becoming cheaper and easier . 
At least we have a chance in the House to talk about this nuclear treaty . 
We think , and here are the reasons , that India is about to attack us '' . 
The soft diplomacy that we have been following is not getting us very far and we are falling behind . 
They were signing petitions and demonstrating outside shopping centres for an end to Strontium 90 in our milk . 
We know the rest of the story . 
Is that the assertion the hon. member is putting forward ? 
Because it does not do that it dooms the process to cynicism . 
Hon. Charles Caccia : 
The cause of the crash remains unknown , but this tragedy might have been avoided. 
How is it that yesterday the solicitor general could not even remember the gender of his seatmate and yet today recalls that it was a Liberal friend ? 
The Prime Minister has no choice but to demand his resignation . 
Hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
No one knows this . 
Mr. Janko Peric ( Cambridge , Lib . ) : 
In commemorating the passing of Donald Munro , we recognize not only one who shared with us the elections of the House but a man who gave his entire adult life to the service of his country and his fellow Canadians . 
More than that , we also know that these weapons pose the greatest danger to civilian populations and to our planet as a whole . 
As I recall , and my colleagues will also recall this , one of the first actions taken by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois , who is now the Premier of Quebec and will be for a long time - this is our strong belief , and I can see my colleague nodding in agreement , he being one of the finest minds of his generation , I might say without fear of exaggerating , and above all an extremely wise statesman - was to appoint me , the young member for Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , a dashing idealist , happy to be here while not losing sight of the need to defend the interests of Quebec , as the critic for conversion of the military industry to civilian uses . 
We have some repenting and rethinking to do on this . 
Mr. Chairman , I have a brief supplementary to the minister on the same issue . 
These are major issues that relate to our responsibilities as parliamentarians . 
In examining the issue of cost recovery and the key areas of the bill I call on my colleagues on all sides of the House to give support to Bill C - 53 . 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
The fact is that in the next such application , the dissenting judge could find an ally and the decision could be two to one in the opposite direction . 
They learn by example . 
It said that in the interest of strengthening the equal treatment of homosexual and lesbian couples the cabinet would this year introduce a bill to open civil marriage to persons of the same sex . 
Some speakers missed some of the points . 
First in September 1997 we allocated close to $ 3 million for active measures to help the 300 or so affected workers quickly re - enter the labour market .

Two years ago Bishop Beardy led his first walk to show solidarity with survivors of abuse of aboriginal children in residential schools in the 1950 s and 1960 s . 
The hon. members have written questions . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Prime Minister . 
What is is amazing is that hon. members only have this to talk about . 
APEC SUMMIT 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
That this House express its profound concern over the recent grave attacks on the Iranian Baha ' i community including the brutal execution of Mr. Rahu ' llah Rawhani in July , arrests of 36 Baha ' i academics , and confirmation of death sentences of two Baha ' i men and the detention of 11 other Baha ' i men for practising their faith ; and calls upon the Government of Iran to end their oppression of the Baha ' i community , ensure the safety and early release of all those Baha ' i imprisoned in Iran , and respect the principles of the International Covenants on Human Rights to which Iran is a party . 
Is that agreed ? 
It saves the taxpayer $ 30,000 per child . 
It ensures that only officials with law enforcement duties can execute search warrants . 
I have appended the letters sent to him and to your colleagues in the federal government . 
I think we are at the point where we need to do some rethinking of this collective addiction to gambling , rather than expanding upon it , which is basically what Bill C - 51 does . 
As well , the bill will benefit police enforcement . 
Instead , the government is concentrating on aspects of how early a person convicted of a crime can be released. 
I think the Liberals in this House should be absolutely ashamed of themselves . 
We also support them through Canada ' s millennium scholarship fund which was established in the last budget . 
When it has been decided that someone has the skills and the ability to attend such an event , the funding should be adequate . 
He attacked young people . 
These plans include air strikes aimed at the capacity of the Yugoslav army and police to drive people from their homes and to try to use that in a selective way to show they cannot use these forces as a form of intimidation and terror against their own population . 
Before I conclude I want to assure members that we have already , as a concern related to Canadians within Yugoslavia , given warning notices to dependants and the non - essential staff at our embassy . 
Are we considering using ground troops ? 
I have not seen it yet . 
The international community must intervene in Kosovo , in the Yugoslav Federal Republic , to ensure that its people have some chance of a better life . 
Once double standards are lifted we will live in a better international community . 
Be it further resolved that the federal NDP affirms and recognizes the right of self - determination for the people of Kosovo to decide their own political future without the fear of oppression and the military presence of the Serbian armed forces . 
This is a risk , but a risk that Canada must take . 
All the issues involved here and the difficulties in getting security council support for further action if necessary had been part of the daily media coverage . 
It seems to me that these are very sensible proposals made by the Council of Europe , by the assembly and by our European colleagues . 
As we speak , 250,000 innocent civilians have been displaced and 50,000 innocent Albanian people from Kosovo are in the forests freezing , starving and sick . 
This is the type of life that the people in Kosovo are living at the behest of their own government . 
As winter fast approaches some 50,000 people including children and the elderly are either without shelter or are afraid to return to what remains of their homes . 
Mr. Speaker , I appreciate the insight shared by the hon. member for Toronto Centre - Rosedale . 
We certainly have a moral obligation to take action against ethnic cleansing . 
Does it not want to get into the fray ? 
The individuals who are part of those diplomatic missions , who are part of the human rights missions , must be allowed to do their work and inform the international community of what is happening there . 
CANADA ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION ACT 
Hon. Andy Scott 
HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Bill Matthews : 
The salmon fishing has increased. 
All those opposed will please say nay . 
There is no doubt about this government ' s apathy , because it could , right now , take effective action against money laundering . 
I have some concern with this provision in light of the ongoing capitulation of the provincial Liberal government in my home province of Nova Scotia in dealing with the ITT Sheraton casinos in both Halifax and Sydney . 
An article in the Edmonton Sun headlined " Top judges skeptical of soft sentence trend " read : 
The life of crime has been shown to these young people as a way to live . 
Because of the election in 1997 , he had to start all over , as he did in June . 
Frontline officers have serious concerns about their abilities to provide adequate services and protection to the public . 
As long as advertisers are able to make a product look exciting and youthful , as if all young people are doing it , as if all of our heroes are doing the smoking thing , it will look attractive and will draw more people in . 
Then of course there is chewing tobacco , which some people might choose to chew . 
The Speaker : 
This means that , each time the separatists ask questions in the House , make speeches and , in particular , hold press conferences , they are expected to reflect the views of their constituents . 
So there is only one question left . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
* * * 
The member for Palliser could not make this up . 
Tobacco has many defenders but , no matter what , nobody can come up with a defence . 
I do not want the member to pretend that this is all , because it is only part of a very large strategy . 
As a former teacher I taught grade seven students for a number of years . 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan : 
As I said , one of the worst problems with the current extradition process in Canada has to do with the complexity of the evidentiary requirements imposed on foreign countries filing requests for extradition with Canada . 
Bill C - 40 will now allow Canada to send suspects to a permanent international court . 
We have called a number of government departments and have read the bill very thoroughly ourselves . 
This is why it is so important to have judiciary guarantees in a constitutional state . 
We are in favour of enhanced human rights protections and safeguards for persons who are the subject of an extradition request . 
Lastly , the government will not hesitate to consult and involve all stakeholders , including young Canadians themselves , and to take advice from them . 
In fact , since these limitations have been imposed , thousands of young Quebeckers have had to go on welfare . 
The picture is very grim . 
AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY 
Hon. Andy Scott 
Mr. Jay Hill 
She pointed out that the process has in fact speeded up dramatically due to changes in 1992 when amendments were made to the extradition legislation . 
Tasha said that at least we were rid of him and he would not remain in Canada . 
If someone is a drug dealer in another country or if someone raped and pillaged in another country , exactly what do we think they are going to do here ? 
Ms. Albina Guarnieri ( Mississauga East , Lib . ) : 
I wish to thank the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the leadership role he has played and his effective efforts in lobbying the American Congress and Senate for a Canadian exemption to this ill - conceived legislation . 
What does it take ? 
The hon. member is prejudging the whole matter . 
Mr. Speaker , last week , the Solicitor General chatted about the matters under his responsibility on a plane . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if there is a circus atmosphere in this House , the hon. member and his colleagues in the opposition are the ones responsible for it . 
It is no surprise that the latest initiative opposed to the AFS comes from band members themselves . 
It goes beyond the lack of caring for fish stocks to the way that other people using the rivers are being troubled. 
It is a positive initiative , but there are certainly more questions that will have to be addressed at the justice committee . 
Mr. Speaker , those types of low comments across the way indicate to us the lack of respect that the people of Alberta get in this institution and around this place when proposing these types of fundamental changes . 
I am probably stretching this as a point of order but I want to make the point that many of us will be involved in committee hearings . 
I will speak as a consumer . 
Clause 50.1 ( 2 ) ( a ) ( ii ) would allow the courts to interfere in what constitutes a reasonable profit . 
NATIONAL SPORTS CENTRE 
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
( Official Version ) 
We will recall that , in 1993 , the electoral promises of the Liberals included a national child care service . 
The shocking reality is that on average child care workers are paid less than zoo keepers . 
The national children ' s agenda will build upon efforts already under way by federal , provincial and territorial governments , community groups , business and voluntary sectors , child care professionals and of course families themselves who have the greatest responsibility for their children ' s welfare . 
Since the integrity and reliability of electronic transmissions must be ensured , provisions to foster the practical development and implementation of secure electronic signatures are a key component of the bill . 
It provides information , for example , about what is happening to the ice caps . 
The situation on the sea is similar . 
This bill will disappoint a great many people . 
It has not demanded any sort of access mechanism that would allow it to intercept and decode these kinds of messages . 
Just as the Y 2 K bug impacts every facet of government and what we try to accomplish in this House , so does the Internet . 
Copyright infringements are a serious concern which cannot be successfully addressed by one nation . 
The secret code authorizes the finance minister to spend the EI surplus , greedily siphoning it away from workers and employers . 
We are not , as the Leader of the Opposition is , comparing the students with criminals . 
The Speaker : 
Premier Klein wants to hold a good faith vote on an elected Senate . 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister for International Trade . 
I consider this to be a different point that the hon. House leader for the opposition has brought forth . 
That the government is back at the table today in Paris and not taking the lead of France and walking away would , I am sure , upset these folks . 
Mr. Speaker , the Liberal member for Markham is very knowledgeable on information technologies issues , judging from the comments he just made . 
Part of the process of the agreement was in recognition that encryption could also work the other way around . 
Of course , he said that none of us would want our medical records read or seen by just anyone , or our personal correspondence intercepted. 
One can reasonably state that the Quebec bill is stricter and more encompassing both in its form - it truly is a bill - and its definitions , its clear wording and the power to issue orders it gives the commissioner , something that is lacking in the federal bill . 
Mr. Speaker , if the member opposite would like to participate in the debate , he is welcome . 
Anyway , we have until 6.30 p.m. You will understand that my throat will be tired well before that , but I feel like continuing the analysis of this bill in more detail , if the House gives its unanimous consent . 
It has to go back to the drawing board , yes , but we have to start " from scratch '' . 
Is it really a matter of having to protect what religion we are or is it , as I said in my earlier remarks , a matter of protecting information that relates to our financial ability ? 
I am sure it can be purchased now anyway . 
My father was told the same thing : " If you do not move , we will be close to your house and you will not get anything '' . 
What does the provincial legislation say ? 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Mr. Jim Abbott 
Mr. Jack Ramsay 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
If Liberal MPs say that the commission has the power to allocate those funds , I say to them that they are misleading Canadians . 
Mr. Speaker , I charge that the government is undermining the RCMP by making this a biased process , thereby making it impossible for Canadians to believe that anything coming out of this inquiry which may exonerate certain actions of the RCMP is anything more than a cover - up . 
That is not his role . 
I suggest adamantly that the mandate itself does not include the ability for this commission to go into the area of political interference . 
I would be barely back in my office when I would be summoned to report to the CEO and be promptly fired on the spot . 
How can anyone have faith in us as parliamentarians when we see a government take action such as it did against the former chairman of the fisheries and oceans committee and against the member for Vancouver Quadra who basically spoke the opinions of Canadians ? 
I quote from the commission - 
We all know that . 
He quotes the source of that statistic . 
Whether we agree with these students is not the issue . 
Mr. John McKay ( Scarborough East , Lib . ) : 
If that is not enough , they can also hark back to when female Liberal MPs were forced to keep silent when this government broke its promise and refused to obey the Human Rights Tribunal ' s decision on wage equity . 
Canada will soon become a member of the UN security council , and this is certainly to the credit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
* * * 
The Speaker : 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
This is all the more shocking because a study by his own department has not been able to refute this . 
The member is asking us if we are prepared to transfer money for health . 
I think it is very important that we have the full evidence from the transportation safety board , whether it is on the Swissair crash , the landing last night by British Airways or even the incident last week involving an Air Canada jet landing at Thunder Bay , before we jump to any conclusions . 
It has had 3,000 cases in its history . 
The Prime Minister alluded to this in answering questions the week before last . 
He went on to a second and a third joke . 
However , in a situation where the students have no legal representation and are faced with seven lawyers , it is no longer accessible , equal or fair . 
Madam Speaker , I made the decision last Thursday and communicated it to the panel last Friday . 
It could give the students just one - fourth of what it is spending on its lawyers ' hourly fees and expenses for accommodation , transportation and so on . 
Even in more challenging disputes , we must not lose sight of the fact that the commission ' s public hearings are , essentially , inquiries of public interest ; the commission should not be fettered by the kind of precise rules that govern criminal and civil trials . 
It is a media game . 
That is why all members should consider supporting this motion when we vote on it later today . 
YEAS 
In turn , the insurance industry recovers these costs from consumers of insurance through rate increases and of course higher deductibles . 
There is no other area of law where evidence is as important and where circumstances play such a preponderant role . 
So already the person who happens to be using the car while an offence is being committed , but we are not sure if that is indictable , summary , or hybrid , is already taken care of . 
I hope members over there open their eyes before it is too late . 
( The House adjourned at 7.49 p.m. )

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
Mr. Speaker , what is it about dealing with foreign fishing issues that makes our minister of oceans fold up like a deck of cards ?

How can the Prime Minister let people think that the commission can look after representation for the students , when his Solicitor General has said the very opposite ? 
IMMIGRATION 
Hon. Andy Scott ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
CHILD POVERTY 
GASOLINE 
Some hon. members : 
My concern was that the government has actually been cutting back on the services of the RCMP in British Columbia by way of budget cuts amounting to about $ 8.5 million . 
In many cases these are retired people who then took that income , paid their taxes and then made other investment decisions . 
About three years ago , the auditor general indicated that , on December 23 , 1991 , around midnight , without consulting their ministers or even being accountable - no need to establish an agency for that purpose - senior officials from Revenue Canada , Finance Canada and Justice Canada decided to transfer $ 2 billion in family trusts to the United States without collecting a penny in tax . 
There is a myriad of things that could be done to improve the taxation system in Canada . 
Some have gone even further to indicate : " The fact that my position will be guaranteed for only two years after the agency commences as well as a threat to my negotiated benefits greatly disturbs me . 
The public policy forum study commissioned by Revenue Canada found that among the businesses surveyed some 68 % believed a single tax collection agency would either increase their compliance cost or have absolutely no impact whatsoever . 
In reality , this monster will be nothing less than the transformation of the present Department of Revenue into an agency independent of the government , which will have a mandate to negotiate an arrangement with the provinces and the municipalities so interested for the collection of taxes in Canada . 
Some farmers along the border started exporting this grain and found out they needed an export licence . 
As for the proposed amendment to paragraph 9 ( 1 ) ( e ) , it would allow the minister to get an annual report on the Canadian Wheat Board ' s activities . 
It would only stand to reason that an annual audit be allowed to ensure that the Canadian Wheat Board is indeed accountable and transparent to the farmers it is supposed to represent . 
He says every trader on the floor knows this . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal 
Mr. Maurice Dumas 
Hon. Andy Scott ( for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development , Lib . ) moved for leave to introduce Bill C - 56 , an act respecting an agreement with the Norway House Cree Nation for the settlement of matters arising from the flooding of land and respecting the establishment of certain reserves in the province of Manitoba . 
We must say to every person in Canada that we take their privacy seriously and that we are going to protect it . 
We have been giving that information away individually for a very long time , for example every time we give our credit card to someone for our Christmas shopping . 
Excellent legislation that applies not only to government agencies but also to the private sector . 
The report goes on : 
There should not exist a timetable for when tax regulations will be fair . 
Mr. Walt Lastewka : 
More and more people are providing information about themselves . 
First , it may be useful to talk about the definition of electronic commerce . 
Not a single freshman in law school would dare hand in an assignment containing a title like this . 
They would perhaps do well to look at what Quebec is doing and follow its example . 
Section 5 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms , passed in 1975 , reads as follows : 
The only way we can do something about it now is to get it in committee and get it examined by our colleagues . 
This reality should give us food for thought and raise the alarm . 
We must only mention their title .

HEALTH 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
Band members have told me they cannot get travel money when they need to go to Vancouver or Terrace for a CAT scan or to see a specialist . 
This is primordial. 
Some hon. members : 
No. 
Does she have the support of the Minister for International Trade , the Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food and the Minister of Industry ? 
With this measure , Heritage Canada paid Canada Post nearly $ 50 million to have it accord certain magazines reduced rates . 
I am rising to speak to Bill C - 55 . 
These are questions we have to ask . 
The key word in the last statement is natural. 
Madam Speaker , I thank my hon. colleague for the information . 
Protection does not enter into very many of those industries . 
If not , I hope and I demand that the Government of Canada apologize to the Mills family . 
That is what he said in question period this week . 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
Therefore on June 19 , 1998 we announced an additional $ 730 million for a program called the fishery restructuring and adjustment measures . 
Hon. David Anderson 
Friday , October 23 , 1998 
In recent years the mint ' s commercial activities have been impacted by intensive international competition , changing investment markets , economic slowdowns and recessions . 
We will go no further on this but it is very important that we recognize these things . 
We have some concerns , some of which have already been mentioned. 
Mr. St é phan Tremblay ( Lac - Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , today a Vancouver newspaper reported that APEC commission chairman Gerald Morin was overheard in a Prince Albert casino saying that the RCMP would take the fall for APEC . 
We do not know exactly what Mr. Morin is supposed to have done . 
I ask members to direct their questions through the Chair . 
Also , if there is an atmosphere of distrust , I have to say that this was created in an unfair and unwarranted way by the kinds of questions asked by the hon. member . 
Does the Deputy Prime Minister think it is acceptable to limit Parliament ' s control when it comes to issues so important to the public interest ? 
To date , the Department of National Defence ' s investment in the research and development amounts to approximately $ 8 million . 
The decision would be solely that of cabinet . 
Some hon. members : 
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi 
Mr. Monte Solberg 
In addition , clause 5 ( a ) of the bill mentions fishing rights but this term is not defined. 
If the parliamentary secretary can fish for 68 days in Prince Edward Island , why can we not do it ? 
The king has no power to transfer such public fisheries to an exclusive group . 
That is very clear . 
So , if there were problems three weeks before the federal election , I am sure there are still problems today . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his comment and question . 
My colleagues across the way are arguing that it is a good program . 
I would argue that of course we need to hide this fund off so that we are not in a situation where either the government has to kick money in or employers have to kick money in to bail out the government . 
It is not hard to develop a surplus when nobody qualifies any more and the few people who do qualify are getting reduced benefits and for a shorter period of time . 
When the last round of employment insurance changes was being proposed by this government , I spoke out against aspects of the legislation that would penalize people who want to work , but this government did not listen . 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
As they come to the wire , the finance minister is making a valiant effort but he is held back by extra EI premiums that are forcing him to use the whip on workers and businesses . 
If the minister chooses fairness he will give this money back to the people it belongs to . 
In co - operation with other Canadians , we Quebeckers have built a country that is the envy of the world and we will continue to improve it . 
Mr. Speaker , I am glad that the opposition has finally come to its senses and has realized that the circumstances on reserves are difficult and do need the support of all of us . 
The cost of a Christmas party is now to be a taxable benefit . 
* * * 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye ( Portneuf , BQ ) : 
Mr. Peter Adams : 
If that is the case , then that is evidence to show how useful the small weeks pilot is . 
The federal government is applying that surplus in the EI account against general revenues . 
Mr. Dick Harris : 
The approach of saying that what works in one part of the country will not work in another is what underlies a lot of the policies of the Liberal government that have caused division in this country . 
Money is being slowly siphoned out of the pockets of the unemployed to plump up the EI fund while this government is no longer contributing anything at all . 
The member is right on . 
I would like her to remind us of the adverse effects that the EI reform has had on women . 
In this piece of legislation when we talk about the big weeks and the small weeks , we are actually looking for a formula to address unemployment . 
Make it plain to everybody but make it plain through the Chair . 
If they truly believed what they are saying they would not sit as members of parliament because they do not represent Canada . 
We have proved to the minister a number of times that he is wrong . 
Even the premier of Nova Scotia , a former colleague of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , has asked the minister to meet with the co - op.

These boats were catching tuna within a rock ' s throw of the dock in Canso . 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) : 
We saw it happen with the APEC situation . 
Canadians want change . 
They are meaningless and the government would not release those reports . 
Members 
Bill C - 43 establishes a number of accountability mechanisms that will ensure that the agency despite its new structure and potential increase in services on behalf of the provinces and territories will remain accountable to parliament and its clients and to the public for its action . 
I have here in my pocket the results of a byelection in Saskatchewan last night . 
So it is not a reason to stand in the way of an agency that will be competitive within our economy . 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in Canada . 
* * * 
We introduced a constitutional amendment , the first one in years , to help the Quebec government remedy this problem . 
Mr. Pierre Brien : 
Number two , I allege that the Prime Minister or his office is involved in the continuing work against the commission . 
BANK SERVICE CHARGES 
They know , for they live with it every day . 
Madam Speaker , we have heard a lot of fearmongering on the other side with regard to the establishment of this agency . 
- I am shocked - . 
I sent a letter to Andr é Ouellet to draw his attention to the fact that the exterior of the Canada Post building , a building rented by Canada Post Corporation but owned by Public Works and Government Services Canada , was in a sorry state . 
For any new human resources initiative , principles such as fairness and equity would always be safeguarded. 
He is probably interested in getting the job of commissioner of the agency after his political career . 
He realizes that there is only one taxpayer and that a change like this could benefit that taxpayer . 
The next question is on the main motion . 
Mr. Speaker , the members of the Progressive Conservative Party vote nay on this motion . 
Ms. Albot was a contributor to the Liberal Party of Canada ' s campaign fund , I even have the amount here . 
That is why the Progressive Conservative Party cannot support this motion . 
The role of the government is to ensure that no one is barred from employment for factors which have nothing to do with their ability . 
Once again I am asking the minister - 
Mr. Myron Thompson 
Pay Equity 
Mr. Speaker , last week Judge Tom Goodson , an aboriginal member of the provincial court of Alberta , was appointed to conduct a fatality inquiry into the shooting of Connie and Ty Jacobs . 
The United States and the European Union value and protect their farmers , but the Canadian agriculture minister has yet to acknowledge the existence of a crisis here . 
Mr. Speaker , the Prime Minister says he needs a consensus before he will take action . 
When will she talk to the grassroots , find out what the problems are and come up with some solutions ? 
Mr. Speaker , we need to stop interrupting question period for these Liberal commercials . 
Why is the minister sending unarmed Canadians into this war zone ? 
Some hon. members : 
Is that agreed ? 
In many instances these changes amount to simply changing the name of the relevant court or judge in definition sections of the act . 
The one member from the Reform Party who was here at that time voted against it . 
It is a territory that is able to start from scratch . 
Would my colleague be in favour of us taking a look at this kind of system working in the vast territories of northern B.C. where there are huge areas that are even larger than Nunavut ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
These people live in an area of Canada that experiences a harsh climate . 
It does not cause me as much concern as the whole concept of Nunavut in the first place , but I am certainly not embracing the notion that some Canadians by dint of their geographical location or other distinguishing reasons ought to have access to a different justice system with different rules and regulations and different protocols than the rest of Canada has access to . 
There are a number of ways of doing it . 
In plain terms a financial transaction tax can be any tax . 
Why ? 
Hon. Marcel Mass é 
Mr. John O ' Reilly 
Mr. Rick Laliberte 
- National Revenue , Votes 1 b and 10 b 
The bill before the House today meets a pivotal challenge in our pursuit of that important promise . 
If this bill were not in place , Canadian magazines would not be able to compete with split - run editions of foreign magazines that have no editorial costs . 
What we are seeing are the benefits of competition . 
Most people today make connections with their neighbours around their province and around the country through weekly newspapers and little publications like that . 
In conclusion , the NDP will support the principles of the bill and we will be voting in favour of it at second reading . 
That having been said , the government must give Canadian publishers the assurance that the new measures will not result in another trade crisis . 
What is supposed to be saving magazines in Canada is actually crippling the industry . 
The member shares the premise that if foreign magazines were allowed to purchase advertising services in the country they could not or would not offer deeply discounted service . 
Our dollar is in the toilet . 
Some American presidential candidate is going to use the opportunity of a WTO ruling on this bill and they are going to come back and hurt Canada bad for political reasons . 
I do not think that is an issue that is resonating across the country . 
They do not ask me about the minister of heritage and Bill C - 55 , and what a great impact that will have on their daily lives . 
That is clearly infringing on people ' s freedoms . 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
I will begin by saying that we oppose this bill . 
In the 1920 s Dr. Elsie MacGill was the first woman to get a degree at the University of Toronto and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . 
St. John ' s is one of Canada ' s 11 capital cities . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , they are going to put substitute crews in but you are not bringing in the new helicopters . 
I remind him that even Jean Charest , a former federal member of parliament , preferred to be away from the House partying rather than have to vote on these resolutions the Prime Minister is boasting about . 
As a government we have begun consultations with all of our farmers across the country to make sure that we have a very strong independent position when we go to the new talks coming up . 
We just need to ask park employees about the cuts in the maintenance schedules , programs and infrastructure upgrades . 
Section 92 provides that , in each province , the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to matters coming within the following classes of subjects : the management and sale of the public lands belonging to the province and of the timber and wood thereon , in paragraph 5 ; property and civil rights in the province , in paragraph 13 ; and generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province , in paragraph 16 . 
All government orders - in - council are suspect in principle . 
We know about the mismanagement of the fisheries . 
The bill will provide the legislation needed to establish and manage a system of marine conservation areas representative of the 29 marine areas in Canada , reflecting the relevant Parks Canada guiding principles and operating policies for them . 
This could have some negative effects because the goals of the minister in charge of Canadian heritage may differ from the goals of the minister in charge of fisheries and oceans . 
I mentioned cruise ships . 
They are under tight budgetary constraints . 
How can we keep something that does not exist ? 
This approach would inject new life into these organizations and would make them more effective in protecting safety and in resolving conflicts . 
Our current military is under attack through underutilized resources . 
The order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order paper . 
However , it is an absolute disgrace that in the same envelope they received from the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was another letter saying that the ship they were on would be tied up and they would be laid off . 
MEDIA CONCENTRATION 
Food Labelling 
It is fair to say that under the direction of the Minister of Industry , Canada has become a world leader in electronic commerce , at least as far as public policy is concerned. 
Moreover , this schedule is not the model code on personal information protection that was developed by the private sector and by consumers to serve as a framework for the protection of personal information on a voluntary basis . 
From now on , it will no longer be the case , since all the provisions that go beyond provincial jurisdiction will be subject to federal legislation . 
You can only struggle for so long '' . 
Mr. Speaker , the employment insurance fund belongs to millions of Canadians , but because of this Prime Minister , every worker is paying $ 350 too much and every small business is paying $ 500 per worker too much . 
MEDIA CONCENTRATION 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Minister of Labour , Lib . ) : 
Recent Treasury Board surveys show that many federal departments will not be ready and that national defence is one of the very least prepared departments . 
First of all , Pearson airport is operating safely . 
BILL C - 68 
He said that he understood my disappointment and the disappointment of the consumers . 
Also , the tools provided in Bill C - 54 are ineffective , since the commissioner cannot issue orders . 
I remind the House that the Bloc voted against government legislation like that of Bill C - 20 , amendments to the Competition Act intended to fight deceptive telemarketers . 
An act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected , used or disclosed in certain circumstances , by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act , the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act . 
Moreover , we fear that , with these weaknesses in the bill , the minister will never be able to reach his primary objective , which is to promote consumers ' confidence in the development of electronic commerce . 
I understand the debate is about to collapse , but my constituents would not want to see trade and commerce over the Internet hampered by what might be at this point an innocuous attempt to bring in a tax that would begin to discourage entrepreneurs from using the Internet to transact all kinds of transactions . 
I received recently a briefing on some of the e - commerce tax issues . 
It is quite clear that the minister is focusing on the expansion of electronic commerce at the expense of privacy . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
PETITIONS 
It is very important to make what its role is public . 
We have seen a lot of debate in this House in these last few weeks , certainly since we came back into this House in September , that has little to do with reality , little to do with actions of individuals and a lot to do with an attempt by members of this House to personally discredit and attack individuals . 
The opposition at that time went on a fishing expedition and found a goodly amount of information with regard to what the government was up to on the Charlottetown accord . 
We understand it was the upcoming OECD conference that pushed the government into action . 
Bill C - 54 , in some cases , will restrict the rights of Quebeckers , rights they enjoy under provincial legislation . 
It is not surprising that the current government is putting forward a personal information protection bill that is , for all intents and purposes , weak , inefficient and contrary to another right which has become fundamental these days , the protection of personal information . 
I repeat : " Every person has a right to respect for his private life '' . 
No. 
Quebec does not have the right to transfer these titles to the Canadian government . 
QUEBEC ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
Mr. Speaker , very simply , every announcement the government has made on EI premiums has been welcomed by employers and by employees and they will be in the future . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
That is the truth . 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) : 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
The department does not have a list of the 10 most common reasons for which these permits were issued on behalf of the minister because data is not collated in this manner . 
We know from experience that having a number of departments involved in the same project makes it difficult for them to work together and ends up costing taxpayers a lot of money . 
On this note I am also very proud of the leadership which was displayed recently in my riding near the town of St. Martins in the development of the Fundy trail parkway . 
The minister supports the Makaw whale hunt . 
This legislation clearly does not do that . 
This is why we think these consultations are a sham . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
However , I have to say to the member , as a Canadian , that there are too many examples across the country where major problems have been created in the environment because provincial governments have not acted. 
But no , today , Liberals say " The federal government , even to establish these marine parks , will have to be the owner of the seabed '' . 
Mr. Speaker , I did not expect them to react that strongly . 
How can he explain that ? 
I will now try to ask a different question to the Liberal member . 
The Bloc Quebecois members although they do not like the nationalist component in this legislation have certainly indicated that they agree in principle with the general idea of preserving these ecosystems .

Hon. Lyle Vanclief 
Mr. Jim Abbott ( Kootenay - Columbia , Ref. ) : 
We ' ve been the good guys on the block . 
If the government wants to restore some measure of confidence in its ability to manage economic crises other than by resorting to denials , excuses and diversions , let it respond positively to the motion before the House . 
When the final , most accurate numbers do become available , which are numbers that have been put together with the co - operation and agreement of the provinces , I will remind members that some of the numbers they have been stating in the last half hour in this House are incorrect . 
Is the minister saying that farmers should not expect to make their living from agriculture ? 
The second question raised by my colleague - and I am glad he raised it because that was what I was saying at the end of my speech - is that , unlike the other provinces , Quebec does not have the same measures for its farm safety - net programs , its companion programs , and does not apply them in the same way . 
Mr. Speaker , the issue on the floor of the House of Commons today is a very important one . 
I know Joe Clark would but I am worried about David Orchard . 
The majority of farm families today have one of the partners and in many cases both partners out working . 
The Canadian government collects $ 2.7 billion in fuel taxes from the four western provinces , yet it only returns $ 35 million . 
In addition , depreciation expenses will grow in 1998 to take into account the substantial capital investments made in this industry in recent years . 
The debt to equity ratio has been declining since 1991 . 
This government must make modifications to the existing safety net program such as NISA and follow through with promises to develop a whole farm safety net program that includes disaster relief . 
That is utter nonsense . 
The minister has also invited the provincial ministers of agriculture to deal with the current situations that are faced by our agriculture sector . 
The government must have known that when we download these responsibilities to the farmers , their income is going to drop rapidly and that is one of the major reasons why we have such a crisis today . 
I also wish to take this opportunity to congratulate all the municipal councillors who were elected or re - elected in these cities in the riding of Lac - Saint - Louis .

Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
We will let the commission do its work . 
Last week , I drew the attention of both the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health to the trafficking in datura stramonius , the fruit of a hallucinatory plant that is not currently prohibited in Canada and that has devastating effects . 
* * * 
They fought for their homes , for their families and for their country . 
True justice and freedom must always be the guiding principles for the leaders of Canada , leaders who inherited the trust of those who never made it back . 
Federal income and payroll taxes are bad enough , but due to offloading by senior governments , many rural municipalities are forced to rely on excessive property taxes to maintain their services . 
This means that producers are playing a direct role in the direction of research and technology development activities . 
Chatham - Kent in southwestern Ontario is Canada ' s largest producer of hemp . 
I remember back in 1970 when wheat was $ 1 a bushel in Interlake and Manitoba . 
It means this . 
Canadian farmers have helped federal and provincial governments to build the farm income system we now have in place . 
It would not surprise me in the least if the day arrives in the not too distant future when members of the Reform caucus will call for the Minister of the Environment to invoke tough federal regulations to protect a particular interest that they may have that day or that they have read about in the Globe and Mail or the National Post that morning , which seem to be the fundamental research documents used by the Reform Party . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to ask a very simple question of the hon. member who just spoke about his concern for the farmers in the Peace River district . 
Mr. Speaker , members of the Progressive Conservative Party are voting in favour of this motion . 
Another area of concentration is cross ownership of newspapers , radio , television , news services and web sites . 
This is called price gouging . 
No , this motion is being made so that the Liberal Party , which has never shied away from big brother style interference in the marketplace , could effectively interfere in the operation of Hollinger Company . 
As Peter Desbarats , a member of the Kent Commission , recently mentioned , Canadians now benefit from a wide array of choices when they seek ideas and information .

The Deputy Speaker : 
In Reform ' s opinion a lot of changes could have been made in this bill that really would have made it important to police , victims , prosecutors and the courts , especially to victims and the Canadian public . 
Again our amendment fell on deaf ears . 
We also want to address the issue of child prostitution . 
The government had no choice but to introduce this amendment authorizing casinos on cruise ships sailing on the St. Lawrence River . 
It was my suggestion that those sections ought to be taken out of this omnibus bill and introduced on their own merit . 
That is not a sentence . 
I would like to have the member ' s thoughts on that . 
Frequently the picture of a business generally on a balance sheet is quite limited. 
In greater Vancouver , part of the world with which I am most familiar , air is killing 900 people each year . 
This proposal , as the hon. member indicated , should be considered. 
I am not entirely convinced that we can confer a certain kind of benefit on one class of citizen without expanding the benefit to other classes of citizen , all of whom are transit riders . 
Mr. Gar Knutson 
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
THE ENVIRONMENT 
This bill is my effort for the 36 th parliament . 
The general response from the Liberal members of the committee just before they defeated the amendment was that it was under study . 
These are major investigations . 
This piece of legislation brings about an amendment to the Criminal Code that would allow for prosecution after a year and a day for crimes related to murder and manslaughter . 
This is something we should be more supportive of not only in the House but in all parts of Canada . 
Mr. Ken Epp : 
I am sure I speak for all of us here today when I say this . 
However , if the government ' s agenda is to slowly erode the Indian Act in order to give the Indian leadership more power at the expense of the powerless , even the right to sovereign self - government but without accountability , then the government should declare those intentions . 
In closing , I want to point out to this House that Mr. Mandela referred to Canadians as a people . 
I was even told yesterday or the day before that there was only about a 50 % chance that this bill would be debated on Friday . 
The Bloc Quebecois will , in parliamentary committee , take a close look at clause 17 , which I read earlier and which deals with the breakdown of marriages . 
That is why each translation takes a little longer to read . 
That does not happen . 
As I mentioned earlier , the legislation is long overdue and eagerly awaited by the first nations that are anxious to begin implementation . 
While the suit is in regards to the Indian Act , the plaintiffs also claim that a process should be included in the framework agreement to address this issue . 
The hon. member for Parkdale - High Park has the floor .

It is only the established powers that tend to resist because the status quo serves them quite well . 
In June , the minister appointed an investigator to examine the impact of marriage breakdown on property rights . 
I know he has experienced this himself .

Under most conditions they would quote one poll or another to support their position . 
For instance , students with permanent disabilities such as deafness , blindness or other physical or learning disabilities are eligible for a Canada study grant of up to $ 5,000 a year to cover exceptional education related costs that might result from the disability . 
That is particularly clear in the case of the millennium scholarships . 
Each claimant will be allowed a 17 % federal tax credit on the interest portion of payments of federal and provincial student loans .

Over the years , thanks to donations of many corporate and private sponsors , this event has grown . 
That prebudget consultation is not yet done so they are a little bit ahead of themselves in that regard . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , here we have good old Bill C - 42 . 
That is documented and every major health think tank and association in Canada agrees with those figures , as does every member of parliament , including members of the government . 
Some hon. members : 
We would have liked to see all these things limited with more specific limitations on them in Bill C - 48 . 
I was born in the region of Acadia known as Mayflower , in the municipality of Clare .

It is clear that the Speaker cannot get involved in the process of formulating questions for the House , but neither , I suggest , can the House leaders . 
Human Resources Development Canada , HRDC , is currently reviewing available information on the small weeks adjustment projects and will be considering whether they should be renewed. 
This effectively eliminates from consideration many parcels of land that have an existing third party interest , even something as basic as a right - of - way . 
It is incumbent on us that we do not proceed within a huge vacuum of misunderstanding concerning the meaning of self - government . 
Some of the first nations were shortchanged when their reserves were developed. 
I wonder if the member for New Brunswick Southwest would like to clarify the comments he made so that I could better understand where he is coming from . 
But what I do not agree with is the minister ' s statement that first nations are making their own decisions and defining how they want to be governed. 
I hear people laughing . 
There was no way , due to a number of different factors , of ever laying charges or having a solution through the criminal courts . 
This process has been spearheaded in Saskatchewan where a treaty land entitlement framework agreement signed in 1992 has paved the way for the final agreements with individual first nations . 
They keep mentioning the matter of accountability . 
These are not just allegations because they were willing to press ahead with them in court .

Some hon. members : 
I verified his income and his monthly take home pay after taxes . 
He is a stand - up comic . 
To try to weave something to do with tax reform into a small business act is a non - starter . 
But we have to approach it with the concept of why they are borrowing the money in the first place . 
We also voted against it , not because we are against increasing access to financing for small businesses but because we do not believe the way to do it is through taxpayer funded programs . 
They no longer have this mentality of trying to get a job with large businesses or government organizations , since jobs are now very scarce in these sectors . 
Young people are being told they ought to start up their own businesses . 
What good is it to have hog houses in a given region if , once hogs have reached their ideal weight for human consumption , they are shipped by truck or train over hundreds of kilometres to facilities where they will be slaughtered , processed and shipped overseas or sold for domestic consumption in Canada ? 
A whole new series of measures are included in the legislation to provide for the audit and examination of various reports to verify that this act and the regulations are being complied with in respect of a loan , including that the lender has exercised due diligence , as provided in the regulations , in the approval and administration of the loan . 
What we see are stagnant growth rates and high levels of unemployment . 
In talking to people outside this country time after time they make the point that they do not want to come to Canada to invest because our payroll taxes are very high . 
I too will read the proposed motion : 
The Liberals sit on the other side and think they have money . 
If that does not sound , smell , taste or look like a subsidy to the financial institutions I would like to know what it is .

We are in favour of the principle but we have to appeal. 
We will protect it , we will pass Bill C - 54 . 
Will he take steps to ensure that children ' s safety is put first ? 
I have been given information from several Canada Post employees that Mr. Barry Bennett , the director of the Fredericton region , used the Fredericton sorting station to store his sports car last winter . 
We saw that again today in question period when the Minister of Finance said that it is okay for the government to do that kind of thing , that it is well within the government ' s purview to do that . 
If a businessman does not deserve or cannot be provided with financing by somebody , maybe death will be there in the long run anyway . 
I will use an example of exactly what I think happens to small business when government gets in the way . 
He wants to keep that money . 
Motion No. 3 
Some 85 loans were still outstanding under the program when the bill was being developed. 
We must take into account the costs of a business not being able to get off the ground as well as the risk of problems for small and medium size businesses . 
I explained that my business , prior to being a member of parliament , was specializing in the financing of home based businesses . 
I would like to be able to start my presentation by stating that we have every reason to be proud of living in this country because Canada is internationally recognized as one of the leading proponents of human justice , as a country whose society is said to acknowledge every human being ' s right to dignity , respect and equal opportunities . 
Bill S - 11 does not infringe on the provinces ' legislative powers since the Canadian Human Rights Act only applies to areas under federal jurisdiction .

My colleague , the hon. member for Palliser , has sworn under oath an affidavit documenting the minister ' s prejudging of the outcome of the inquiry . 
It would take $ 3 billion out of old age pensions . 
I ask the minister , and I hope that he does not evade the question today , does the minister still believe that a levy of 50 cents a carton for prevention purposes is a good thing or not ? 
Could he tell us what was accomplished to advance bilateral relations and Canadian interests in the region ? 
PETITIONS 
The fact is the very commendable objectives of the bill are of broad public policy , namely to reduce smoking related health costs for young people and for supporting tobacco farmers and others . 
It will probably reduce the possibility of civil litigation and restrictive legislation being enacted , both of which restrict the industry ' s very existence . 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this serious discussion of whether or not Bill S - 13 is in order to be pursued in this Chamber . 
Any intervention by the Speaker at this point before the House is fully seized with the complexities of Bill S - 13 would deny the House the opportunity to perform its usual duties to deliberate on these questions . 
Notwithstanding the constitutional arguments , notwithstanding the procedural arguments , notwithstanding whether this is a tax or a levy or an impost , if there is a will to pass this legislation surely we can agree among ourselves today to just set this aside and the government can introduce a ways and means motion tomorrow morning . 
The purpose of the levy , as stated in the bill , is to meet an industry purpose beneficial to it , although this industry purpose also has a public benefit . 
That is in order . 
The police know their hands are tied , especially if this happens on a Saturday afternoon rather than prowling by night on residential property . 
This is a crime whose victims , more often than not , are women .

FERTILIZER INDUSTRY 
Hon. Herb Gray 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Perhaps the ship - owner minister playing around with these figures does , but certainly not the average person . 
That is the reason why our government cannot and will not support this motion . 
These are only a few examples of the Liberal government spending priorities over spending on health care . 
We know the impact that had on health care systems across the country . 
I will stand to defend everything that we did. 
For example , in 1994 , social transfers averaged $ 678 per capita . 
That money does not even belong to the government '' . 
It may be sexy to find out about one item that appears to be illustrative of what is wrong with the system but let us also be honest in our debate . 
Moreover , increasing the cash floor was not the only spending commitment made to improve the situation in the health care sector . 
There is a reason why , when all the provinces met , they unanimously urged the federal government to return the money it had cut to all the provinces because this government believes some provinces are better than others ; there are some provincial governments it likes and others it does not . 
What do we see ? 
I do not expect opposition parties to congratulate the government , but I would expect someone with a provincial bias , whose sole purpose in life is to promote provincial autonomy , provincial authority and provincial government , at least to acknowledge that our health care system is with all its warts and bumps the finest health care system in the world . 
I would like to see it in areas where we can see a return on that investment . 
I will come back to citation 57 of Beauchesne ' s which speaks of the work of parliament in camera .

He went to the nearest big centre in Saskatchewan and because it was a severe problem he was referred immediately to a surgeon . 
Clearly the finance minister was anticipating challenges such as today ' s opposition motion on the CHST. 
I ask the hon. member what we have been trying to find out since this morning : 
In 1994 , the President of the Treasury Board told us he was able to reduce government spending by $ 18 billion . 
We cannot see how this will go to the legitimate needs of the people of Ontario . 
The point is not simply to spend more but to spend more in a way that will produce better results '' . 
The Acting Speaker : 
Bill C - 442 exhibits vision . 
This control over various local governments and various local instruments is the responsibility of a provincial government - or a state government , in the United States - and not of the federal government .

They have something obstructing their vision .

I invite my colleagues in the House to join me in supporting National Child Day and all the activities that will help Canadian children get a good start in life . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today , on behalf of the caucus of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada , to recognize national child day . 
Mr. Speaker , yesterday Canadians sadly observed the first solicitor general in history to enter the witness protection program . 
APEC INQUIRY 
Hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
That is all . 
This situation was caused because of an inability to acquire this particular piece of property when Highway 403 was built . 
Second reading 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Some hon. members : 
By suggesting that this legislation simply be scrapped , the member is closing the door to any constructive discussion that might lead to a workable consensus benefiting everyone . 
Within months of its passage and movement in the direction of the gun registry it became clear this was not possible . 
Agreed. 
A full time bookkeeper is needed to keep up with the bureaucracy , the paperwork , whether it is the GST or the payroll tax forms or worker compensation forms . 
This is not parliament as it was intended to be , which brings me to the matter of time allocation . 
We have banks . 
The House has heard the terms of the motion . 
We also want to offer our congratulations to Ron Lancaster , Don Southern , Danny McManus , Darrel Flutie and all the rest of the Hamilton Tiger Cats . 
I congratulate and thank Madam Lucie Breau of N é guac for organizing these special events in my community and for all those who are here on the Hill today to celebrate with us the orange drapeau . 
The government has an obligation to pursue the truth over the entire APEC affair . 
Mr. Speaker , there is a debate going on at this moment in front of the commission . 
Will the President of the Treasury Board assure this House today that the federal government will be well prepared for the coming of the new millennium ? 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
The entrepreneurs who start these small firms and the spirit that drives them and moves them to succeed are Canada ' s economic hope for the future . 
We would have hoped for a broader vision for all government programs , not only those of the federal government , and that they would have been compared to those of the provinces , especially Quebec , and the financial opportunities offered by such organizations as the CFDC . 
When the tax man comes , it is not a voluntary donation that we make . 
That activity emerging from the small business community is something we can all be proud of . 
Mr. Lee Morrison : 
That would make sure the person who is wanting to borrow this money would have enough confidence that they would assume liability for half . 
Nobody gives out jobs to their political friends better than Liberals . 
If government wants to support volunteer organizations there are other means to do it . 
Motion No. 8 would include working capital as one of the pilot projects . 
Mr. Walt Lastewka : 
We cannot have that shoved through the opposition or through the members and we cannot have that pass through this House . 
[ Editor ' s Note : 
Mr. Speaker , I think you will find unanimous consent to have members who voted on the preceding motion recorded as having voted on the motion now before the House , with Liberal members voting nay . 
YEAS 
To make matters worse , there are suggestions that the government is looking to change how it defines poverty . 
Finally , we need to address fundamental human resources and organizational culture issues , such as the need for scientific staff to understand the larger context in which their work takes place . 
Mr. Richard Marceau 
Mr. Louis Plamondon 
People today tend to think their sons and daughters should all become doctors or lawyers , or maybe even parliamentarians one day . 
Many of their customers are publicly traded companies and they rely on the overall health of the global economy and the overall strength of the Canadian economy for their success . 
Young people have an opportunity to get involved in aspects of business and can volunteer to assist business , particularly small business . 
The government needs the regulations in place by January 1 , 1999 , so that the banking industry can have the requisite 90 days to implement changes . 
Hopes , dreams and hard work go down . 
This is quite a problem . 
It authorizes the establishment and operation of pilot projects to determine whether the program should be extended to include loans to the voluntary sector , and involving capital leases . 
One is to extend the program guarantees to cover capital leasing . 
Knowledge based industries are among the most dynamic job producing companies in Canada today . 
Under the revised program , parliament will release more accurate information and performance measurements by which to judge the program ' s effectiveness . 
This is also an area of jurisdiction for a Canadian financial services ombudsman . 
The other case at hand when we come to government throwing capital to small businesses is who pays when a venture collapses . 
The Small Business Loans Act has been serving Canada ' s small business community since 1961 . 
Through changes to employment insurance , $ 927 million has been taken out of the New Brunswick economy . 
I congratulate Ms. Bolster for her creativity and contribution to Canadian culture . 
The trend , blamed on mismanagement by both federal officials and Indian leaders , has continued for the past five years . 
But is the real danger not going back to square one , but ending up there ? 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Mr. John Duncan ( Vancouver Island North , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be meeting with the presidents of financial institutions , including the large banks . 
Sometimes , when a program is described in a booklet or some other type of brochure , we realize that the funds are no longer available , that the structures have changed or that the programs themselves have changed. 
Mr. Speaker , thank you for giving me the floor in this debate at third reading , after the magnificent speech by the member for L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re . 
When this happens , we are tempted to say that the costs are too high , that the amount paid out of the contingency fund for losses is too large . 
The bill provides for the continuous operation of the program subject to a comprehensive review every five years . 
Furthermore , it was one of my favorite themes , mainly on the regional level , when I entered politics . 
We must look at the issue beyond this bill . 
I think this openness should be encouraged to spread . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
This is another affront to the institution of the auditor general. 
We think that is completely unacceptable . 
It is a national disgrace . 
You deposit your money , and the banker refuses to tell you exactly how much is in the account . 
However , all of us agree that inequitable , ineffective and unaffordable ad hoc measures are not the answer . 
QUEBEC ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
DRINKING WATER 
PRIVATE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS 
On November 30 , a Liberal government would be a credible spokesperson on social union . 
He is angry that it came out at all and that the affidavit was filed and that it was released. 
Mr. Speaker , it is not very complicated. 
Why not do the only reasonable thing and impose a moratorium ? 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for reminding this House that her government could not put forward retroactive legislation either . 
Mr. Speaker , perhaps on one point I will acknowledge that the member may have a legitimate point of order and that is in reference to one document which was quoted by a minister late last week . 
They are simply asking the government to undertake a fair tax reform so that people can pay their fair share as opposed to most Canadians being exploited by an unfair tax system . 
I did not think we were finished with that particular part of Routine Proceedings . 
It says no once and for all to tobacco companies using sponsorship to link their deadly products to popular youth oriented events and lifestyles . 
We should not start talking to individuals when they are 17 , 18 , 20 or 22 years old about quitting smoking . 
Mr. Peter Adams : 
In two years ' time , they will have to find another sponsor . 
It is my duty , pursuant to Standing Order 38 , to inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows : the hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt , Taxation ; the hon. member for Churchill , Solicitor General of Canada ; the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre , Health Protection Branch . 
In other words , there has to be federal - provincial agreement to do that . 
I do not think there is an answer other than that . 
Therefore I believe it is not necessary to assert the primary claim of parliament to members ' attendance by giving members an unfettered right to avoid testifying as witnesses in court . 
Until the 19 th century , in the U . K . reporting what was said in parliament was treated as contempt ; until then , members required this privilege only for the purpose of avoiding prosecution by the king . 
There are practical reasons that need to be respected in order for these exercises to be fulfilled. 
Needless to say , Mr. Tkatch was not impressed either . 
Mr. Randy White 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief 
Mr. Gerald Keddy 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
After looking at how Heritage Canada went about consulting on its draft bill and at the results of that consultation , the Bloc Quebecois concluded that the exercise was a miserable failure and that it was really too bad that , with all the resources at the minister ' s disposal , she did not see fit to conduct real consultations , which would have made all the flaws in the bill apparent to her . 
This must be written into enabling legislation which would be acceptable for future needs. 
The Bloc Quebecois will never support a bill that does not respect Quebec ' s jurisdictions . 
Oh good , it will be coming back . 
The principle is a particular type of conservation , marine conservation . 
Quebeckers will figure it out and be all the more convinced that pulling out of the federation is the right thing to do . 
Coastal populations , environmental organizations , all stakeholders must be invited to take part in the consultation process to express their views . 
Those who have been following the negotiations of the framework agreement on first nations land management will be aware as well that the process has brought the 14 signatories together in a spirit of co - operation . 
That is why we have the terrible situation we are faced with today . 
The final answer to the member ' s question is there will be another meeting hosted by my friend from Wild Rose in Edmonton this Saturday . 
I believe the majority of the Canadian public and backbench Liberal MPs will agree these concerns warrant a rethinking of the way the government deals with land management issues . 
One comment that sunk deep into my thoughts was from an ex - chief of the Siksika nation in Alberta . 
Third , there should be compensation for all the victims of hepatitis C from dirty blood . 
The PQ has resorted to tricks , intellectual dishonesty , ploys and manipulation . 
The Europeans are subsidizing unfairly $ 60 billion a year to their farmers . 
How many more farmers have to go bankrupt before the minister and the government find compassion and announce a comprehensive compensation package ? 
Mr. Speaker , how can the minister explain that , while the ten premiers agree on social union , he is the one dragging his feet , the one in no hurry , the one who seems to want to sabotage the talks ? 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
The impetus to create this legislation came from the first nations which developed a workable land management system to enable them to manage and control their lands and resources . 
It is a good bill . 
Both these first nations were among the five affected by the flooding in the 1970 s and both signed the northern flood agreement . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad : 
Monday morning there was an announcement on the radio saying that there should be some results that afternoon . 
We send observers all over the world , most recently to observe an election in Chiapas , Mexico. 
Farmers are leaving their farms in droves as our fishing people have done in our coastal communities as well . 
Mr. Tony Valeri : 
With this motion one adjective is being replaced with three adjectives and it does not help to clarify anything . 
It happens rarely , but it has happened at Revenue Canada . 
It simply means printing another ballot . 
I must confess that I have not spent hundreds of hours preparing for such a debate and my constituents will surely forgive me , because many in Quebec believe the Senate to be an obsolete institution they could quite happily do without . 
I believe most of those voters are really thinking of a triple E Senate , not just elected. 
We abolished its equivalent in Quebec , the legislative council , at the end of the 1960 s . 
I am not against foreign aid , but Shamattawa has asked for less than one - tenth of what Russia got and received nothing . 
Hon. St é phane Dion 
Bill C - 457 . 
In addition , on - site inspections may be carried out under the treaty to clarify the situation following a nuclear incident . 
Agreed. 
You give me the list and I will choose from that list instead of from my own list of Liberal hacks '' . 
Last year there were over 110,000 abortions in Canada with a cost to our health care system of over $ 10 million . 
They accused the Canadian Wheat Board of illegally dumping Canadian grain . 
Mr. Ken Epp ( Elk Island , Ref. ) : 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond - Guiral ( Laval Centre , BQ ) : 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott ( Wanuskewin , Ref. ) : 
But the fact is that I had earned $ 4,000 to pay the $ 2,400 bills because we have taxes on taxes . 
Tax treaties and manipulation of the law cost our taxpayers billions of dollars . 
However , the tragedy could have been much bigger if the inadequate sewage facilities had led to an outbreak of disease . 
( a ) by an Indian or any other person acting as sub - lessor under a lease from the Minister under subsection 58 ( 3 ) ; or 
We are discussing something else altogether , a bill to impose provincial laws where there is federal jurisdiction . 
I would have to argue with those members opposed to Bill C - 402 that striking another committee to look at the issue does not help at this point. 
Mr. Preston Manning 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
Mr. Murray Calder 
The Deputy Speaker : 
I support that . 
I have to be careful what I say . 
I wish the government side would honour the motion in order to honour the men and women and the workers of the resource who risk their lives every day in order to put food on our tables . 
This proposed legislation on extradition is an important component of that scheme . 
That is why it is important to have the most up to date legislation possible . 
That concludes my remarks . 
If we in Canada feel the death penalty is contrary to what we see as being humanistic treatment of fellow human beings , it is equally important to make sure the same principle carries through with respect to the people we are dealing with under possible extradition orders . 
One such amendment that has received some attention already in this debate was the increased discretion of the minister with respect to this piece of legislation . 
In other words , the extradition order will override the refugee claim . 
With the efforts of the Canadian Diabetes Association and all Canadians we will find a cure for Megan Fitzpatrick and the 1.1 million diabetics in Canada . 
The parliamentary interns will also be visiting office staff to remind them of their drive and to collect food and money for the Outaouais and Ottawa - Carleton food banks . 
Mr. Speaker , I said today the exact same thing I have been saying for weeks . 
* * * 
CANADA POST 
The Speaker : 
Mr. Roy Bailey ( Souris - Moose Mountain , Ref. ) : 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
We want them to have the freedom of expression , to express and to hold views that are consistent with their particular sets of values and beliefs . 
We have not done it for 10 years so we had better do something . 
The hon. member for Selkirk - Interlake is invited to participate , as is anyone . 
Under Bill C - 41 , the Royal Canadian Mint receives corporate status and the power to buy back its own shares . 
I noticed that . 
Many are now members of the Reform Party in Saskatchewan called the Saskatchewan Party led by the former Reform House leader Elwin Hermanson . 
Being from Saskatchewan , the member would know that there is an old saying that when you throw a rock in the dark and a dog yelps you have hit a dog . 
The $ 30 million dollars borrowed by the mint in March is just to build the Winnipeg plant . 
It has been good to work with him , although I will admit that I was there as a substitute and I am not a regular member of that committee . 
They are forced as taxpayers to back up their very competition that is driving business elsewhere . 
People like me would not get up to speak . 
It is called open bidding . 
The current farm income crisis makes it necessary to increase spending in this area . 
It has made a tremendous contribution to the restoration of the country ' s public finances . 
Tonight , therefore , I would like to focus on two questions . 
I will talk for a few minutes about the domestic action that is required. 
Canadian farmers face a crisis now . 
That is a very serious issue . 
Of course that aggregate number hides the problems we know exist . 
Another thing I have been asking a lot of the people is whether NISA and crop insurance is good enough . 
It was a specialty barley . 
In a nutshell , if we fail to act immediately our small and medium size producers are doomed. 
He told a story in a press conference on October 16 organized by me and the member for Palliser . 
The outlook for the next 6 to 10 months appears most unfavourable . 
Canadian farmers have a right to expect such an approach to this problem . 
It is not an issue of whether we can wait or whether the farm community on a national level can wait for assistance . 
From 1974 until 1985 I was a pig producer . 
It would have provided money to directly compensate for damage to commodity prices which could be attributed to unfair trade practices and unfair subsidies in other countries . 
Even the news of an effective plan would give the banks confidence to hang in with our farmers . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy 
Hon. Don Boudria 
Bill C - 41 . 
Agreed. 
Will the member reverse his position on two tiered health care and on eliminating the Canada Health Act ? 
It is not so bad . 
We are asserting , however , that it is indeed a sovereignist government that the people of Quebec elected yesterday , confirming the decision they had made in the 1994 provincial election and in federal elections , first in 1993 and again in 1997 , with more than 60 % of the members from Quebec in this House being sovereignists . 
There is nothing new about new . 
The other element is the matter of the veto , which is not a veto . 
However , it must include a financial commitment from the Minister of Finance , as proposed at the time of the agreement in May and June , and must , in our opinion , also deal with the matter of economic union . 
A Liberal government cannot take the stance it took in the last referendum . 
As federal players we are not seeking to impose our will . 
Negotiations are ongoing . 
What a powerful tool . 
He has written some very eloquent articles on this issue which many of us have read with great admiration . 
These negotiations give us the opportunity to improve Canada ' s social and health policies . 
That is great . 
When there is no option put forward by strong federal leadership , then we have the kind of result which we saw yesterday . 
BILL C - 68 
Of course , the face of AIDS is changing , and today it is more closely associated with intravenous drug use . 
Ms. Val Meredith ( South Surrey - White Rock - Langley , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , if the Prime Minister will withdraw his , I will be pleased to withdraw mine . 
The employment insurance program is not intended to allow the government to accumulate billions of dollars in surplus ; in fact , the act specifically prohibits unreasonably high premiums . 
I find this language to be unparliamentary . 
People come back to me and other people in the party and say halfway through that it is totally irrelevant because the government leaks it to the media . 
Mr. Speaker , if the government House leader would let me continue , I would have an opportunity to establish a direct connection with the point raised by our colleague from the New Democratic Party . 
The government has worked very hard over the past five years to improve our country . 
This will not be an easy task . 
There is no open discussion . 
For the federal government to order - actually not the federal government in this case but the House - by passage of this motion , whether it is December 31 or before the first budget , is setting a setting a condition around these negotiations that we have no authority to set . 
The Prime Minister wants to do it , his ministers want to do it and the premiers want to do it '' . 
It will certainly do this itself , through a foundation to which it will be sure to appoint its friends , people who will carry out the wishes of the federal government .

This Christmas there will be a hole in each worker ' s wallet where $ 300 ought to be for Tiny Tim . 
These men are entitled to better treatment and other people ' s errors should not be a reason for doubt . 
There are 1.5 million children and their families living in poverty . 
Not only is the Government of Canada saying that . 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
How many more premiers have not been consulted about this package ? 
To determine if Bill S - 13 is properly before the House , the Chair must ascertain whether or not it imposes a tax . 
* * * 
Is it agreed ? 
Motion No. 46 
Motion No. 108 
Motion No. 158 
Nav Canada , which controls airports instead of the Department of Transport , makes dictatorial decisions , closes control towers without consulting those concerned , putting the flying public at risk . 
We have a very conservative government across the way . 
The issues raised by the member from the New Democratic Party are relative to the agency and the risks to workers and their job security . 
Tax brackets and credits have not been indexed to inflation , therefore we have had bracket creep that has increased taxes 18 % . 
As far as the Y 2 K bug is concerned , will all the changes that Revenue Canada employees will have to face make it any easier for them to prepare for this transition in informatics , on which much energy already had to be expended ? 
I could go on and on about this . 
Trade between Canada and the United States has more than doubled since the signing of the Canada - U.S. free trade agreement barely 10 years ago . 
I am not surprised by the about - face the government has taken . 
It is very much appreciated. 
The government has said that crews would not be disciplined for refusing to fly the Labradors . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief 
Motion No. 2 
CANADIAN HERITAGE 
If you are prepared to permit this motion , I would move that that take place and that we refer the matter to a committee , if that is appropriate . 
One is that although we can indeed question the minister any time he is in the House , the difficulty is that if someone feels there is a question of privilege we must raise it at the earliest possible moment . 
He had contracted to build a place of business , a manufacturing plant . 
Why would we need a taxpayer bill of rights ? 
The Canada Post Corporation used to report to the government . 
The government first mentioned it in the throne speech in February 1996 . 
An hon. member : 
He will reply that the agency is calling the shots . 
Because it is annoyed with the opposition parties for expressing their disagreement . 
We have those taxes simply because - 
In 1991 , this Parliament established December 6 as a day to remember the tragic loss of these 14 young lives . 
Mr. Speaker , I believe that the Government of Canada has conspired with Canada Post to drive postal franchises out of business . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Let me quote from the auditor general , because he is fond of quoting from the auditor general : 
He says that is too bad . 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
On Monday we will begin with a motion to approve the appointment of the commissioner of official languages . 
I respect the suggestion of the hon. member who sits on the justice committee that perhaps the committee should be looking at this , but there is no process by which we can do that . 
All these agencies must work together if they are to be successful in the war on organized crime . 
The fact is that the RCMP in their documents indicate that $ 74 million or 13 % was cut from RCMP funding for policing services . 
I would like to know why the minister does not want to sit down with the provinces and why he does not want to examine how Quebec manages to harmonize the GST with the QST and then send what we owe to Ottawa . 
While I am not a constitutional law specialist , I know that this bill really goes against the spirit of the Constitution of Canada and of the Canadian confederation , two words that are no longer used because , over the decades , Canada has miraculously evolved from a confederation to a federation of provinces . 
When I was a hot - headed and dashing young university student thirsting for knowledge , I was taught that federalism had three characteristics . 
We raised the issue in the House several times . 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom ( Regina - Qu ' Appelle , NDP ) moved : 
One way is expanding and improving the co - ordination and administration of federal and provincial revenue programs . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Perron ( Rivi è re - des - Mille - Î les , BQ ) moved : 
Several reports on this were carried in the media in my area and in my riding . 
It is very important that we be able to improve the employment insurance system . 
What about those who fall between the cracks ? 
Giving more money to the poor will contribute to the eradication of poverty . 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier 
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Peter MacKay 
No , he is smiling . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
This is required because of the small population of approximately 26,000 spread over such a vast territory with only about 25 settlements . 
His efforts were not for his own gain , but for the benefit of Canadians and our recreational fisheries . 
They adopted the Universal Declaration of Human rights which , half a century later , continues to address directly what is necessary for a life of dignity for every human being . 
In the last budget we announced cuts for lower and middle income Canadians worth billions of dollars . 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano ( Minister of Public Works and Government Services , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau ( Trois - Rivi è res , BQ ) : 
We have to focus differently on areas of providing income support . 
Mr. Speaker , that is very much the spirit of the agreement . 
* * * 
Her participation in Tuesday night ' s hockey game also showed that she is one of the Liberal Party ' s smoothest skaters . 
This area represents less than 5 % of the territory of Nunavut . 
We are not able to support these proposed changes for a number of reasons . 
As my colleague from Souris - Moose Mountain indicated , perhaps it will not be a problem in the prairies because rail lines are disappearing rather quickly . 
The Liberals did not even have the gratitude or openmindedness to notify ahead of time the stakeholders who were to be intimately affected by some of these things . 
Many POPs we are told cause endocrine system defects , immune system dysfunction , reproductive abnormalities and developmental problems in humans . 
Animals at the top of the food chain have been found with unexpectedly high levels of these contaminants which is cause for some concern for Inuit people . 
Mr. John Herron ( Fundy - Royal , PC ) : 
He certainly reinforced the theme of this motion and provided a helpful observation which I will take very seriously . 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
Bill C - 63 . 
National Defence 
The proposal does not , as the sponsor of the bill would have us believe , create a minimum jail sentence of one year when a stolen vehicle is used during the commission of a crime . 
As a lobby group , the chiefs of police come from a particular point of view , as do other lobby groups which try to effect bills . 
Government should pay greater attention to what our police community is saying . 
Over the number of years I have been interviewing people at all levels , professionals in particular , Dyane Adam was particularly well suited for the interview and the job . 
The subcommittees heard from a broad range of stakeholders on their experience with the SIMA system and concluded that the law continued to protect Canadian producers from injury caused by dumped and subsidized imports , while at the same time limiting collateral damage to consumers and downstream users . 
Therefore , it rejected this amendment , which will not be included in the bill . 
This fall various governments in the Organization for Economic Co - operation and Development rejected the MAI and the NAFTA model . 
Bill C - 35 is a step in the right direction . 
In developing countries in particular corruption distorts public policy . 
Are we going to say that we did not try to influence some of the foreign embassies in getting that seat ? 
Friday ' s event was a reminder of the terrible consequences of violence against women . 
APEC INQUIRY 
Hon. Herb Gray ( Deputy Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
* * * 
Since 1995 there have been 1,053 farm bankruptcies . 
Hon. David Anderson ( Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Lib . ) : 
Is there unanimous consent ? 
Madam Speaker , I note again Questions Nos. 132 and 138 . 
Assistant Deputy Chairman : 
I repeat that one of the biggest problems we have with this bill is the fact that it was agreed to in December 1997 , it showed up here on Friday and now there is a great rush to move it through . 
Let us talk about Russia . 
Bill S - 21 is a step in the right direction . 
He is not the only one . 
It seems to me facilitation fees might become pretty large in the next few years and then what of the countries that have not signed on to this pact ? 
Mr. Speaker , Bloc Quebecois members vote no . 
The Speaker : 
NAYS 
One , he is using the surplus to balance his books . 
And that is unacceptable to me . 
AGRICULTURE 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill 
Mr. Gerry Byrne 
I would like to touch on both these matters , why a customs and revenue agency makes sense and how we have improved the bill , and explain why this agency is a sensible idea . 
The truth is that I feel deeply honoured to be the trustee of Canada ' s tax system . 
It is about $ 120 billion that is collected in normal revenues , the gross revenues of the GST plus corporate tax revenues . 
I regret that because it has not yet done so , as the official opposition we have to vote against Bill C - 43 . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay ( Rimouski - Mitis , BQ ) : 
In addition , the agency is given authority on legislation which for most other federal departments and agencies is vested in the Treasury Board and the Public Service Commission . 
He says it will increase tourism , which actually represents 1 % of our GDP . 
Since I have been here the department has deliberately abused the committees . 
Where did my colleague get her information ? 
I will now read the most significant sentence of this clause : 
Each and every one of us has that responsibility . 
Mr. Speaker , I believe the provinces will adopt a wait and see approach . 
More specifically , it looked at the measures that were in place , evaluated how well the department was doing at providing fairness and identified improvements that will be made to provide a greater level of fairness to Revenue Canada ' s clients . 
The fact is that one week after implementation 30 postal outlets have notified Canada Post of their closure . 
Working with this company to develop a chain of fast food stores and cafes , John designed an organizational chart , job description formats , a performance evaluation form and a sales productivity measurement plan . 
Does the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs not agree that the Prime Minister ' s remarks reflect an attitude of contempt not only for the Premier of Quebec but also for all Quebec premiers whom , at one time or another , took the same stand ? 
Mr. Speaker , when the minister does not have the right answers , that is the kind of responses we get . 
Mr. Speaker , the independent election co - ordinator , KPMG , is investigating the problems . 
AVIATION SAFETY 
Mr. Yvan Loubier ( Saint - Hyacinthe - Bagot , BQ ) : 
In addition , I have two unanswered questions on the Notice Paper , Question No. 132 which was asked on September 18 , 1998 , about 80 days ago , and Question No. 138 which was asked on September 24 , 1998 , over 75 days ago . 
If we put questions and cannot get answers , if it takes as long for us to get answers as anybody else , then what is the point of being a member of parliament ? 
Where is the public interest when , in this era of electronic communications , the government is getting ready to transfer to a private agency an incredible amount of personal and financial information on our fellow citizens in Quebec and Canada ? 
Yes , 18 organizations plus some 50 individuals , who came to tell us that there was no unanimity on Bill C - 43 . 
Agreed. 
How many more children live in poverty , compared to 1995 ? 
Mr. Grant Hill ( Macleod , Ref. ) : 
Some hon. members : 
A well educated young population that has marketable skills benefits the individual and the country . 
This responsibility belongs to us all . 
It complements a series of measures which the government has already implemented , measures which were described in detail by other members . 
That is okay . 
The member opposite talked about trade unions and various other organizations which have gone into partnership to improve energy efficiency . 
Again I hope that the member for Winnipeg Centre is talking about encouraging private sector investment in research and development . 
The Canadian government was the principal government in the world and led the world community in making firm commitments to the reduction of ozone depleting gases . 
The Minister of Human Resources Development has been boasting about the millions of dollars he is putting into two programs . 
Mr. Bill Casey 
PRIVILEGE 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs was also very active on the case as was the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , United Nations officials and the famous Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu . 
The Speaker : 
The priority is to restore public confidence in Canada ' s public health care system . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom ( Selkirk - Interlake , Ref. ) : 
They talk a lot about consultation with the provinces . 
Will the minister of fisheries confirm and clarify his statement that if any new arrangements are to be considered , they must clearly show benefits and have the support of the fishers and the provincial governments ? 
I rule that it is not a question of privilege . 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
Mr. Peter Adams 
From 1979 to 1993 , she practised law , concentrating on criminal and labour law , and served as an assistant crown prosecutor . 
SITTING RESUMED 
* * * 
The petitioners draw our attention to the MacKay Task Force on the Future of the Canadian Financial Services Sector which recommends that banks be allowed to retail casualty and property insurance from their branches . 
That this House do now adjourn . 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
Industry 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan 
This year the salmon did not come . 
Downsizing at Fisheries and Oceans has resulted in a shortfall of personnel available to develop new fisheries . 
As well the bill would establish the rights of fishermen to be informed of the decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood in advance . 
Let us build an era of co - operation , one in which people ' s standard of living and quality of life are key issues . 
I commend the committee for devoting at least two of its eight chapters to the priority areas of health care and taxes . 
The proposals contained in the paper " Taxes and Health Care " include a reduction of $ 26 billion in federal taxes over the next three years , starting with a $ 7 billion reduction in employment insurance taxes , payroll taxes that kill jobs , and a $ 19 billion reduction in personal income taxes and capital gains taxes . 
The officials at the employment centres are putting pressure on the unemployed , on those appealing decisions on overpayments . 
Because they spontaneously paid the money back , these people will be penalized in terms of the number of weeks required to get their first benefits . 
They need solid progress toward this important objective . 
What kind of ethics commissioner would have an open discussion with a public office holder about holdings in a blind trust ? 
As fishermen and domestics in New France , soldiers and labourers in Nova Scotia , fur traders for the Hudson ' s Bay Company , prairie farmers , skilled tradesmen , teachers , and businessmen in pre - Confederation British Columbia , African Canadians have brought a wealth of skills to our country and continue to do so . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
When Brian Mulroney started filling his riding with pork , the Liberals cried foul . 
DEVCO 
Only a third of the miners who have spent 25 years underground may qualify for a pension . 
If he wants to bring this issue to the House , I invite him to do so . 
It concerns the issue of human rights . 
These were the tough visionary policies that were required then to provide benefits to Canadians today . 
I ask the member whether he had the same situation in his province . 
However , it turns out to have been poor timing . 
They await an answer . 
This is a cancer which exists within our taxation system . 
We must have a budget with brains , courage and , most important , a heart. 
If read carefully , this report is there to pat the government on the back , tell the minister what a fine , intelligent fellow he is , what a really great job he is doing . 
Mr. Speaker , it is delightful to be back . 
I guess the third 50 % would go to health care . 
I applaud the government for doing that . 
The bare minimum . 
However , the incident took place a few weeks prior to the APEC summit and it is therefore extremely unlikely that he would have been in western Canada at that time . 
So the challenge in this bill was to balance the need for safety with the quality of life of people living near crossings . 
I do not have exact population figures , but - still quoting the mayor - Aston Junction is a " small " municipality . 
The train approaches and the flashing lights block off that crossing . 
Eventually southern Ontario is going to have to move to rail transportation whether they want to admit it or not . 
Motion No. 6 
It would devolve political evolution for the first nations involved and it would give them some self - determination . 
We urge you to vote no to Bill C - 49 . 
I repeat my call to the Liberal government to implement the royal commission on aboriginal peoples recommendations . 
It was interesting to listen to the member for Churchill talking about amendments that we wanted to make to this bill and how we hoped that it would happen anyway . 
With the sword of quick expropriation hanging over their heads , current leaseholders will find few parties willing to buy their leasehold interests , and their property values will plummet . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt : 
So why does the minister perpetuate reserves ? 
At least we could understand if they had the courage to stand and say that and not hide behind nonsensical , almost silly amendments , deleting the names of the participants to the document . 
Madam Speaker , it is definitely not a pleasure to be addressing the bill tonight . 
The track record of band management so far tells us how it will be managed in the future . 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
I am glad to be here after 12 hours . 
They do not want that consultation process because they do not want the outcomes . 
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY 
Mr. John Herron 
Mr. R é al M é nard 
This is not a time for politicians to walk away from their responsibility and once again ask the lawyers and judges of our country to do the job that we do not have the courage to do . 
Does Judge Shaw really think child porn is worthy of protection ? 
The purpose of this system is to allow decisions to be reviewed when questions of law or of fact are in dispute . 
According to his point of view , this is hugely important . 
Canadians want us to be involved and they want to know that their politicians and their parliamentarians are in a position to and willing to assert their values over the values of the courts when those values being asserted by the courts are found to be so out of whack with ordinary everyday common moral sense , which holds that child pornography is wrong , that the possession of it is wrong and that people who are in possession of it should be open to prosecution on the basis of this particular section of the Criminal Code which has been found wrongly to be unconstitutional by this judge . 
Pornography , particularly child pornography , has to been seen as a rot or a rust on the morals of this country . 
Every time ( the pornography ) is shown , that child is injured in its dignity , its reputation , its identity . 
The notwithstanding clause has been used before . 
While they may think they are sweeping the whole situation underneath the carpet by imposing section 33 of the charter , this issue would rear its ugly head again and again with periodic reviews required for the use of section 33 . 
There is no open season for pedophiles in Canadian society as a result of this decision . 
Hon. Anne McLellan : 
We are faced in Canada today with judicial activism that in no way reflects the values of Canadian citizens and Canadian society . 
We have established institutions to deal with and settle conflicts of interpretation , for instance , when a conflict arises with respect to a piece of legislation . 
What we are doing is to ask the justice minister to expedite the appeal process . 
We have heard time and again that there are people who are planning court challenges to take away parents ' rights to discipline and raise their children in the best way they see fit . 
In the Butler case it was ruled that the access to pornographic material is not in the public interest . 
Would it be six weeks until spring ? 
Our hosts admired this government ' s balanced budgets and low interest rates which are powering Canada ' s economy and fuelling job creation . 
I spoke twice to Mr. Bouchard . 
JUSTICE 
The seats are not the problem ; it is the parachutes . 
Why will the Prime Minister not do as he says , come through , clear the air and appoint an independent investigator to check this thing out ? 
It is part of the process and we have an opportunity in the House today to use that part of the process to protect children . 
I am not trying to grab headlines . 
I quote it : 
I have been made aware of the motion you made this morning in the House of Commons calling upon the federal government to enact legislation criminalizing the possession of child pornography . 
As an example , consider that 85 % of teen prostitutes were abused as children . 
There are issues that are going to have to be dealt with . 
The Minister of Justice indicated that it is the will of the Government of Canada that the law continue to be enforced. 
During the break I received an unprecedented number of phone calls on this issue . 
Therefore the legal course of action is the appropriate one . 
That is what we must remember . 
That is the point unfortunately on which I disagree . 
We need to recognize the benefit that they provide to our community both economically and culturally . 
Let us hope we have a real debate and that we can put an end to the one remaining form of discrimination . 
In closing , debt reduction is something we have to consider . 
When it comes to health care those transfer payments that were cut have hit our hospitals extremely hard . 
It is not a determinant . 
First , we have to recommit to the Canada Health Act . 
If they would have followed that pattern , according to my numbers the debt would now be about $ 641 billion . 
An eight cent drop in the value in our dollar is somehow deemed good for business . 
I will utter another connection here , another link which takes us back to the earlier concept of economics as political economy . 
Such is the tragedy of Canadian federalism at the present time . 
It is government ' s role as a first principle to establish the economic environment that will allow Canadians to do that . 
I know it is just a brief thumbnail sketch , but could the member consider supporting something like that ? 
The Canadian government can choose one of two paths for our once proud forces . 
I do not want that . 
Some members in this House talked about what their constituents have been saying to them . 
For example , a young student in police science leaves his job because he has to do a stint at the police institute in order to graduate . 
In fact per capita GDP has not risen through the decade . 
It is called the absolute poverty measure . 
I really want to focus on the budget plan . 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
Mr. Jack Ramsay 
The position of the Bloc Quebecois on this matter is incongruous and hard to explain . 
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF OLDER PERSONS 
What is this Prime Minister waiting for , a subpoena before he will look after everybody who was infected ? 
What we have is a broad package . 
* * * 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay ( Solicitor General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION 
( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) : 
To this end , we conducted consultations with Canadians that have enabled us to put forward today a piece of legislation that addresses their concerns . 
Bill C - 63 was tabled by the minister on December 7 , 1998 . It is intended to replace the current Citizenship Act . Bill C - 63 will be the new Citizenship Act when it passes , hopefully with many amendments about which I will talk in the future . 
Their role is to promote active citizenship in the community . 
We therefore congratulate the minister on this aspect of the bill . 
There is an incompatibility and this is why the Quebec government made representations regarding the fact that the status of adopted child would be granted when the child is still abroad , before the process is finalized in Quebec . 
However , overwhelming I believe what the minister heard during those consultations was that Canadians did not want this rigidity . 
They make it a habit of promoting citizenship . 
Other proposals contained in the most recent report are things that need to be debated. 
But if one really gets out in the jungle , as I did one time , and looks at the real wild animals they are not well dressed , they do not have three piece suits . 
And better distribution of wealth would be achieved. 
My friend from Regina - Qu ' Appelle says : 
In other words , where was the chicken and where was the egg ? 
It is good news that more people are working and have actual salaries and wages to spend in the constituencies and they are not dependent on employment insurance . 
This is not the way to go about resolving it . 
SHEARWATER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
NATIONAL DEFENCE 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am pleased to present a petition on behalf of a number of Canadians , including from my own constituency of Mississauga South . 
... 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel ( Chambly , BQ ) : 
A change is needed in Canada . 
I will explain later on what led my colleagues in the Bloc to move this motion . 
But go see what is going on now in that area since federal funds were transferred to be managed by the provincial government . 
This government has not always done so . 
The problem is that , when funds are transferred to Quebec , they do not get to the regions . 
All this is not to say that all Canadians lead a healthy lifestyle . 
The only thing the federal government has to do in the next budget is to listen to the wishes of the people and the unanimous requests of the provinces , take billions of dollars from its surplus and massively reinvest in health care . 
Is he creating hardship for families in Quebec and in Canada , so that he can look good and keep Bay Street happy ? 
This party and this government believe in those principles and will never transfer any kind of responsibility or ability to the provincial level to negate those principles of public administration , accessibility , portability , universality and comprehensiveness . 
Are we discussing how so many hundreds of patients are waiting to reach the hospital , waiting to be served , sometimes months at a time ? 
The Prime Minister is using this threat of not receiving billions of dollars to get the premiers to agree to his conditions . 
Let us have a co - ordinated system where the left hand knows what the right hand is doing , not what is taking place now where there are so many levels of bureaucracy that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing .

They got their vaccine from the same source . 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy ( Minister of Foreign Affairs , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I guess the Minister of Justice did not hear my question . 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the Minister of Justice assured us that Mr. Justice Shaw ' s ruling was only binding on B.C. provincial court judges and not on other judges in the country . 
There are a number of things to be considered in this point. 
After his hotel experience in Ottawa , this enterprising gentleman invested in another hotel , this time in Daytona Beach , Florida . 
Finally , the fifth principle is public administration , which ensures that only public bodies may administer our health insurance program within a not - for - profit context . 
Mr. R é al M é nard ( Hochelaga - Maisonneuve , BQ ) : 
An illustration of the concrete meaning of $ 1 billion to Quebec is necessary here . 
There were social union discussions today . 
Mr. John Bryden : 
We are here today trying to encourage members across the way to look beyond today , to look beyond the question of dealing with the reinvestment issues and to address what is actually happening to our health care system in terms of privatized health care . 
It being 5.30 p.m. , pursuant to the order made earlier today , all questions necessary to dispose of this motion are deemed to have been put , and a recorded division is deemed to have been requested and deferred until Tuesday , February 9 , 1999 , at the expiry of the time provided for Government Orders . 
The debates have focused on specific operations as well as on the principles and the thrust of Canada ' s peacekeeping policy . 
It seems to me it is important for these people to know that they have the support of not only a small number of people sitting at the cabinet table , but of all parliamentarians , regardless of their political stripes . 
I thought he meant it . 
Hon. Anne McLellan 
Mr. Ken Epp 
To do so would only work to breed a feeling of contempt among the Canadian people toward this House and toward the laws that govern our nation . 
This debate should be subject to proper consultation and scrutiny and not hastily rushed into . 
RETURN TO ORTONA 
The deadly religious violence perpetrated against Christians in India , the inaction of the Indian government and the continuing political persecution of elements of the Christian community in China are only some of the more visible problems being experienced by Christians in various parts of the world . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Mr. Speaker , last Friday , on Zone Libre , the Minister of Human Resources Development finally admitted that the active measures he is now offering older workers who have been laid off , such as those of the BC mine , are not the answer to the special problems of this category of worker .

TRANSPORT 
Mr. Speaker , it gives me great honour today to introduce a bill that would allow union members not to be forced to contribute to political parties on causes against their will . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
It was the people of Canada , the people of the respective provinces of Canada , who got out to the polls in October 1992 and rejected Charlottetown because they rejected the process . 
I take this opportunity to congratulate the hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for proposing a much needed update of the Citizenship of Canada Act . 
I am not a terribly regular churchgoer but I do go . 
The fact that we want to fix the system shows we care about immigration . 
The government can work with and engage Canadians in a very important dialogue to make progress in a concrete way , particularly relative to the environment , given our Kyoto commitments . 
It has put its foot down directly on what will impact on the Kyoto protocol but this protocol is well on its way . 
Mr. Tony Valeri 
Mr. Yvan Loubier 
Mr. Scott Brison 
Although I do not think it is relevant to the case he brought before the Chair , it would certainly be an area that may be of interest to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs . 
I believe it is our duty as legislators to adopt policies which make it possible to attain objectives of public interest which are of vital importance . 
In fact those people typically interested in economics discount environmental arguments and vice versa . 
The Reform Party would work to create a flatter , simpler and fairer tax system . 
They can make up between 15 % and 40 % of total provincial revenues and the payments are unconditional. 
It deserves a little recognition . 
A list is compiled for each province . 
The figures on the procurement of goods and services are not jokes of false data . 
This is a concept that I heard the Liberals , the Tories and the Reformers talk about with respect to different issues . 
I grew up in a rural part of Nova Scotia , in an area where there was not a significant level of opportunity but where there was a sound education system and a health care system that worked , albeit the health care system has been gutted in recent years due to draconian cuts from our federal counterparts. 
I invite all members of the House to join with the government in spreading the Y 2 K preparedness message so that we can work together to turn -

Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
The hon. member for Wild Rose . 
He was able to strike a wise balance between the internal demands of his country , which was not exempt from the tensions relating to the Arab - Israeli conflict , and the regional realities which dictated , after a number of conflicts , the normalization of relations with his neighbours , Israel in particular . 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
From a public relations perspective I do not know how to get the point across . 
In terms of the formula based approach to the equalization formula , which is transparent , up front and very accountable to all citizens of Canada , we provide a basis to transfer moneys to provinces in particular need of those services so that they can provide equally to their constituents . 
As my colleague from Calgary Southeast said and earlier my leader from Calgary Southwest said today , Reform Party does support the concept of equalization but we do think that the program as it is structured now not only is wasteful , vague and ill - defined but actually does some damage . 
It is time that my friends across the way embraced a new approach . 
Mr. Monte Solberg : 
The government seems to think the cost of delivering services to Canadians is the same everywhere and that is just not so . 
Another problem is that the government tells us that this is all governed by a clean , clear mathematical formula but that is not the case . 
Madam Speaker , following on the whole issue of the tax question , has the member given consideration to the benefits received by a province that engages in economic growth and job creation ? 
I would also suggest that he kindly consider calling it something other than an act which suggests that it is already legislation that has passed. 
I will not elaborate on that but it does not work favourably . 
I spent the afternoon listening patiently to the speeches . 
He himself , therefore , is saying that the commission is able to get to the bottom of things , to effectively determine what happened and to submit a report , which , I would remind members , will be made public . 
Since October 1993 , when we came to office , 1.6 million more Canadians are working . 
Mr. John Herron 
PUBLISHING INDUSTRY 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 ( 8 ) , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government ' s response to 10 petitions . 
The dark side for the Liberals on this issue as in others is the international trade and investment agreements , in particular those which they have had a penchant for signing even after they ran against them and even after they said they would not sign them . 
We can replace wood with products from another country or with some other building material. 
Under the Constitution provinces have the responsibility for water management within their borders . 
The problem is the sovereignty , ownership and control of our water , which the Liberals have failed to fix . 
Pardon me , Madam Speaker , but I did not quite catch the beginning of the member ' s question . 
We see examples of cities collapsing in some countries because water is no longer usable . 
In Canada we are in situation unique in the world . 
They are limited to the sharing of treated water with a few neighbouring U.S. communities and a few instances of the trucking of small quantities and volumes of groundwater to the United States . 
The motion states " the government should , in co - operation with the provinces '' , but there seems to be unfinished business with the treaty obligations that were made during the acquisition of this country and the rights to resources . 
We know that rivers flow and lake bodies hold the water that flows into them . 
In the absence of that , of course , there is still the possibility of ongoing legal harassment and actions . 
Before getting into the commercial aspect , I would like to address the environmental aspect . 
It goes on to say " in co - operation with the provinces '' . 
Mr. Speaker , this week is Year 2000 Preparedness Week .

This is equivalent to putting water into 19 million jumbo tank cars each 65 feet long and with a capacity of 34,000 gallons . 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan : 
I do not think there is any question that the reasonableness of what happens with water in general is of concern here . 
Madam Speaker , first of all , the issue involving Sun Belt is about dealing with this resource and managing it in terms of the public interest . 
A study of the northern river basin has provided information on the cumulative impact of development of the Peace , Athabasca and Slave rivers . 
Sometimes we forget too easily . 
We have to discuss the jurisdictional authority over water within Canada and the roles of subnational governments with the federal government in terms of the jurisdiction and beyond that , the role in terms of the conservation of water . 
Is the House ready for the question ? 
I declare the motion carried. 
She is committed to an examination of the act in its entirety . 
She says " I would strongly discourage you from including the notion of a definition within this bill because this would be anomalous . 
We have public schools to send children to . 
We must provide education . 
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS

PRIVATE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS

Mr. Speaker , if the member had listened she would have learned that I said je suis d é sol é . 
They concluded that it was impossible , and I could not get to Amman . 
Hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Ralph E . Goodale ( Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I cannot comment on the program that the member refers to in El Salvador , but I will certainly follow up on that with my colleague who is responsible for CIDA . 
It is not just with equalization where this happens , it is with the transfer of programs that the federal government has to the provinces . 
We believe therefore that the social union will only work if the federal government pays its fair share , is committed to do so in future years and is willing to forswear unilateral reductions in transfer payments . 
On this subject , we applaud the initiative taken by the federal government to consult with the provinces . 
Agreed. 
Canada is the western world ' s most trade dependent nation . 
The Bloc Quebecois has supported this bill from the outset because it acknowledges as legal and legitimate the right of any people to protect its culture against an overly aggresive invader . 
The Reform Party ' s heritage critic has introduced 21 motions on Bill C - 55 , none of which contains any constructive improvements . 
The issue for Canadian magazines or French films or Irish music is whether competition , and the public interest , is best served by this . 
They captured a tremendous amount of the American market . 
A group of people just south of the 49 th parallel are waiting for some little excuse to retaliate . 
But there are many issues and times that I feel this government has acquiesced to the sabre rattling and scare tactics of our neighbours south of the border . 
It was totally ineffective in even bringing up the issue , and totally ineffective in even trying to make this a priority because the Liberals do not consider it to be a priority . 
Agreed. 
Now it is at the point where I cannot go to all the flag day ceremonies in my riding . 
I heard another argument , saying " There is Canada Day , but it is in the middle of the summer . 
I believe the government too often forgets just how important a symbol the Canadian flag is to our identity . 
No. 
Mr. Ken Epp 
HEALTH CARE 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques 
This bill would require that the Transportation Safety Board have authority over any accidents occurring with large trucks and buses in interprovincial or international transport . 
She is absolutely correct that since that time low income families of the country have been devastated by a constant erosion of their incomes . 
With regard to the specifics of the motion I do not agree . 
I will address a technical problem in it shortly . 
Perhaps it is easier for him . 
Ms. Diane St - Jacques ( Shefford , PC ) : 
If we are to deal with child poverty , family poverty , and we know that almost half of it is due to family breakdown in Canada , then the member should be prepared to deal with the reasons the Canadian family is under attack and the reasons the Canadian family is breaking down . 
We can raise the supply of affordable housing in Canada , but that is only half the answer . 
The department should ensure that personnel at all bases have access to well maintained single quarters . 
It is these risks based not on ideology but mathematics that the finance minister must consider when planning his new budget . 
What obligations do governments have to solve this so - called disparity between rich and poor ? 
I doubt if any member of the House has more firsthand knowledge of poverty than I have . 
Madam Speaker , the issue before the House today is probably one of the most important challenges facing our country . 
Tax credits as proposed by the Conservative Party are really an inappropriate approach to dealing with poverty . 
We find the motion financially irresponsible . 
HEALTH CARE 
WASTE REPORT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe : 
Since the Liberals are wringing more taxes out of us , why is it that our health care system is in such a mess ? 
As the delivery agency , ACOA accounted for the money . 
I have offered the services of a mediator to help her and her people negotiate with the Inuit on these issues . 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal ( Surrey Central , Ref. ) : 
She is also calling for a $ 2 billion increase in the Canada social transfer . 
Mr. Speaker , I concur with that good plan , not that you need my concurrence . 
Mr. Speaker , in this complicated federation it is extremely important that when the provinces have requested certain programs it is a collaborative effort . 
Does the member have an answer for that ? 
The member should also know that Saskatchewan was the only province , if not one of only two or three provinces , which backfilled the cutback dollar for dollar . 
Earlier , criticisms were leveled at all the parties that try to find solutions . 
I represent a lot of poor families and a lot of them would not be helped one bit by this motion . 
Nowhere today have we actually touched on that too much . 
Last year the Liberals said they were giving tax breaks to low income earners . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
We must send a clear message to the scientific community that its efforts on human cloning are not welcome in Canada . 
The Liberal government , therefore , has an obligation to introduce a comprehensive piece of legislation similar in content to what was introduced in the previous parliament . 
Some hon. members : 
The presence of numerous toxic substances reminds us of the urgent need to take action . 
Hon. John Manley 
Mr. Gerald Keddy 
Many arguments have been made to deny merchant navy veterans the benefits they have claimed. 
In other cases , the most valuable cargo was placed in the middle of the convoy , the surrounding ships acting as buffers . 
The relationships that develop are a positive demonstration of the best sense of community : people looking out for other people , especially those who are most vulnerable . 
The employment insurance program is a good example . 
Mr. Dick Harris ( Prince George - Bulkley Valley , Ref. ) : 
Hon. Allan Rock ( Minister of Health , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the debate was not about perverts . 
What is Canada doing about this problem of child abuse ? 
Will the minister do the right thing by offering our veterans a just and honourable settlement ? 
In Canada they returned to virtually no support . 
This letter , as I have stated , was sent by our Minister of Veterans Affairs . 
These are all words and phrases that are very familiar and near and dear to the hearts and minds of the government . 
First , the hon. member said that we Liberals despise Reformers . 
Transparency in such cases is vital. 
Duhaime has since claimed the expansion to be a profitable success .

( b ) condemn the genocide of the Armenians and all other acts of genocide committed during our century as the ultimate act of racial , religious and cultural intolerance ; 
We should try to bring closure for the Armenians and Turks and encourage each side to see and recognize the terrible suffering through which the other side went . 
Today we are joined by a number of of representatives of the Armenian National Committee and I want to salute them : 
Everybody in that part of the world was committing atrocities . 
This bill is very important to all members of the PC caucus . 
The point is that Newfoundland is poised to take a more substantive role in the economy of Canada . 
Why are kids who go to university in one province having to pay two or three times more than other people in the same dorm ? 
The opposition and by extension all Canadians outside government circles were given three sitting days notice to consider $ 35 billion in spending that will extend well into the mandate of the next government . 
Although they did not know it , these striking workers laid the groundwork for the sweeping social movement in Quebec known as the Quiet Revolution . 
The Bloc Quebecois will be working at modernizing and improving this important rehabilitation tool . 
Mr. Speaker , I remind the leader of the Bloc Quebecois that last December we announced the permanent renewal of the Canada Jobs Fund , precisely in order to invest in job creation in regions where the unemployment rate is still very high . 
The figures show that , in 1998 , 143,000 jobs were created for young people , a 20 - year high . 
Here in Canada , we understand the challenges and difficulties faced by isolated northern communities in such situations in winter . 
We will hear the member ' s question . 
They are concerned about the various bilateral agreements that fail to protect Canada ' s social programs , environmental programs and a variety of benefit programs . 
We should be examining legislation that average Canadians can understand that is so clear that it does not need special exemptions and rulings , that focuses the benefits of any program on the people who need it most . 
Madam Speaker , when we are discussing equalization payments , what we are trying to do is establish a level playing field for Canadians no matter where they happen to live in the country . 
That is an incredible amount of money . 
Let us not be so arrogant that we think it cannot be improved. 
What will be the record of this government ? 
I am very disappointed that we are dealing with time allocation . 
If people have concerns about being on the periphery perhaps they are elsewhere . 
They came out to my riding and said the following what about the future of the CFB Chilliwack lands ? . 
A number of such problems in the equalization process are not addressed in the legislation . 
Let us take a look at some of the realities that have already been mentioned by a few of my colleagues . 
One thing is also true : we in the House have a responsibility to reflect upon those kinds of amendments and to think carefully about them . 
It has been examined for two years by federal and provincial representatives . 
Ten million was transferred to B.C. from other divisions of the force , cadet training was frozen at the depot in Regina and other serious cuts in policing were implemented , leaving Canadians dangerously under protected. 
Since that time I have realized that the confusion on this matter clearly lies in Ottawa with the department of Indian affairs which is making up the rules as it goes along . 
Hon. Ethel Blondin - Andrew 
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ' PENSION FUND 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to present a petition to the House with 245 signatures from British Columbia . 
I make that comment because quite often what happens is that members of the government throw names at members of the opposition who would point out problems with the system . 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi : 
All citizens are equal ; this is an inviolable principle . 
It has cheapened the notion of Canadian citizenship , that people can buy their way into this country . 
I want to point out to the minister of immigration that perhaps this ignores the problem of someone entering Canada , making a refugee claim , having a child while in Canada and then having the refugee claim refused. 
Yet the government fights harder and harder and spends more money for criminals to stay here than it does for law - abiding citizens who immigrate to this country to stay here . 
I cannot believe any responsible person elected to this House would allow this section to be in the bill . 
Mr. John Reynolds : 
However , at first blush we accept the laws of our country and we will respect them . 
Why do we set a negative premise ? 
Furthermore , once the committee discharges its duty in relationship to this bill , it will be engaging in a revision of the Immigration Act which will result in a bill being brought before the House . 
On his birthright statement , the member feels that any child born in Canada should have the privilege of becoming a citizen of the country . 
How does this bill reverse the terrible records of this department in the last 25 years ? 
If they bear a child while they are in Canada , what happens to that child ? 
I will now ask a whole series of questions . 
Xin nian kuai le . 
A recent directive prevented veterans from continuing to observe this custom in certain churches in southeastern New Brunswick . 
That is why we had a very good meeting two weeks ago . 
They do not belong there and in fact have to go back to the taxpayers who paid for them in the first place . 
* * *

Mr. John Cannis : 
They are given a deportation order . 
It is not a government office . 
A doctor was being interviewed by a CBC reporter , a doctor who I believe was working in Vancouver in an emergency ward in a major hospital. 
They may even be dangerous criminals or terrorists with dark objectives either within Canada or elsewhere . 
Let me share with this House a couple of facts . 
It is not . 
This will bring the health component of the CHST to the level it was before the period of restraint in the mid - 1990 s . 
Over the next five years , the provinces will receive $ 11.5 billion in new cash through the CHST for health . 
That family received $ 145 in tax relief from the 1998 budget . 
LIBERAL TASK FORCE 
Mr. Gerald Keddy 
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
Mr. Speaker , behind the highlights of the budget presented yesterday by the Minister of Finance lies the need to build today for the future . 
The Speaker : 
Oh , oh . 
Mr. Speaker , as you know , the EI system was completely reformed two and a half years ago so as to serve Canadians better , with the result that there are far fewer unemployed Canadians today than there were a few years back . 
Yesterday , when the budget speech was delivered , we found out that a third administrative body , a trust , will be set up to manage an amount of $ 3.5 billion taken from the current budget to be distributed to the provinces over a three - year period . 
Beauchesne ' s fifth edition states that by definition : 
The hon. member for Saskatoon - Humboldt has said in this House that he was assaulted or touched or pushed. 
The bottom line is that Canadians are paying more GST under a government that promised to abolish it than they have ever paid before , 38 % more in total than when the government took office . 
They also wanted a new minister of finance with greater transparency . 
Therefore , I move the following amendment to the amendment : 
Surely that is a reasonable sentence . 
Mr. Speaker , first off , I wish to congratulate my New Democratic Party colleague for her great sensitivity to the less fortunate , particularly children . 
During a transitional period , during a time of immense change , both economically driven and technologically driven , there are regions of our country where people need help to make that type of change . 
Mr. Scott Brison : 
Last year with the debt ratio dropping , the portion of each revenue dollar needed to service the debt fell to 27 cents , which allows the government more flexibility and more opportunity to reinvest in Canadian priorities . 
Madam Speaker , the rhetoric of rubbish is the only way I can speak to that . 
That makes absolutely no sense . 
We argue that we should attract investment here for the high tech and biotech industries by cutting the capital gains inclusion rate in half . 
The French intention to withdraw from the force at the end of the current mandate raises several important issues . 
Those are always taken into consideration when we decide to deploy people overseas . 
Then what we should do is have two or however many party members from each party and extra ones from the government present the party position . 
I have also heard a lot of rhetoric . 
The UN must have an opportunity to approve the intervention by soldiers from various national contingents on behalf of NATO . 
Has the Prime Minister decided to take unilateral control over decision making around Canada going to war or has he handed that over to the NATO generals ? 
All the House leaders agreed that the debate should take place tonight because the House will not be in session next week . 
This being said , tonight ' s debate is on Kosovo and that geopolitical region . 
Unfortunately your time is up . 
We are gratified by the contributions made by all members of the House so far and are taking careful note of the points raised by members of all parties here tonight . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Mississauga South . 
We have had signs , over the last few weeks , that efforts to solve this conflict would intensify . 
Mr. Robert Bertrand ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
We clearly have invested significant personnel and resources in order to promote peace and security there and have made a genuine and meaningful difference . 
We have no heavy lift helicopters . 
As we were leaving Vienna 45 innocent Kosovar civilians were taken out by the Serbian police in charge of that country and shot point blank , massacred. 
Canada takes an active role in the OSCE , the Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe , an organization which has been directly involved in the Kosovo issue . 
How are we dealing with the hatred in the minds of those ethic people ? 
Mr. John Harvard 
Hon. Paul Martin 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill 
What makes me even more enthusiastic about this budget is that as a physician this budget has focused on health . 
Poverty is a very clear indicator of health . 
That means that there will be in the unemployment insurance fund , what they call employment insurance - it is shameful to have such terminology for such purposes - somewhere around $ 25 billion taken from the pockets of the most disadvantaged. 
When we ask questions here in the House about the millennium scholarships , we are told that we must ask the foundation . 
Last August I concluded a prebudget survey asking constituents what they would like to see in the budget . 
I would like to know how the member believes that this budget is reflecting the needs of the one million poor children in this country who received nothing whatsoever from the budget , not at all affected by the child tax credit . 
That went out this morning to all sorts of people who are curious about this weekend ' s events . 
We measure the value of a government not by how it treats the Bob Cleghorns of the world , the millionaires . 
That may not sound like a lot of money but it is a substantial increase of almost $ 4,000 to a low income family of two . 
In those days , the number of young children who depended on their parents ' work and care was even greater than the number of seniors who will depend on social services and on their families in the future . 
It does not provide for the irresponsible withering away of the federal government , as the Reform Party demands . 
That is not my comment . 
There is a lot of doubt in the minds of ordinary Canadians as to what the minister has really done in the last six budgets he has brought into this House . 
Mr. Speaker , the hon. member was talking about numbers earlier . 
Mr. George Proud : 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for the question . 
I would like to make another little announcement today . 
If it does not occur , war will break out and thousands more innocent people will die . 
Mr. Speaker , if members want more , here is what Premier Klein really said. 
Order , please . 
That is the reality . 
Could the minister tell me how this initiative might benefit people in my riding of Sault Ste. Marie and Canadians in other parts of the country ? 
There are new search and rescue helicopters and submarines . 
After 1957 , Walter Harris had a long career as a lawyer in Markham , Ontario . 
We will see Canada pension plan premiums increase by a whopping 73 % over the next few years . 
This act aims to protect all Canadians , including our children , from the damaging effects of toxic substances by identifying them quicker and controlling them faster . 
During prebudget consultations Canadians voiced one main concern , the importance of their health system . 
This is the real intention behind this government ' s long - standing strategy . 
That is what that means . 
But then again , that too will be blamed on the federal government . 
I must tell my colleagues from Quebec who were applauding that I cannot understand them . 
Those were the projections unless the deficit could be beat . 
If we add all this up , what do we get ? 
We cannot bribe them to stay here . 
Again I ask the member from the Liberal government will he go to the finance minister and ask him to lower taxes substantially and do it as soon as possible . 
How much do we find ? 
If we look at Devco ' s mining operations and remove the workers compensation and environmental liabilities , we see a profitable business , a business that will now be passed to a private firm to extract private profit . 
UNITED ALTERNATIVE 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier 
It had been left wide open . 
As of the 1981 census about 75 % of Chinese origin Canadians resided in B.C. and in Ontario . 
The hon. member for North Vancouver . 
The minister may also grant citizenship to someone who was born outside Canada to a citizen parent , is less than 28 years old , has resided in Canada for at least three of the past five years and has not been convicted. 
Never mind that Redfern Resources Ltd. went through a rigorous three and a half year review . 
The Liberals send their best , 
I would like to think sometime in my adult life before I retire I am going to get some tax relief . 
It could be threatened because of some international protocols being enforced by NASCO . 
Hon. St é phane Dion ( President of the Queen ' s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs , Lib . ) : 
We will do so and we will keep everybody fully informed. 
Third , a contingency reserve of $ 3 billion . 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
He declared that , so that is the way it is . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
This again represents a form of downloading . 
It is difficult to arrange counselling sessions or group discussions when there is no money with which to rent a room . 
First of all , it does not put youth crime and adjustment problems in proper perspective . 
Mr. Dick Proctor 
THE SENATE 
Mr. Robert D . Nault 
We have a Minister of Labour who believes that $ 400 million in government cuts to a crown corporation has nothing to do with the monetary issues in collective bargaining . 
Canadian interest in broadcasting has existed since the beginning of this century . 
They talk about globalization , how Canada has to be competitive , and how we have to be aware of what is happening around the world . 
He has indicated that he is ready for the vote . 
Currently the Indian Act gives authority to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development to expropriate reserve land for the first nation ' s benefit under section 18 for the general welfare of the band . 
I guess that is what we have come to know in western Canada as western alienation . 
I strongly urge the Members of Parliament to table this proposed piece of legislation , call for further public consultation from all sides of the issue with well informed input from the ones who will be affected. 
Not unlike a political party that was born about the same time , Theoren Fleury cast a long shadow across the western landscape and won the affection and respect of Canadians from sea to sea to sea . 
Who will search on and on 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to be able to respond to the acting leader for the opposition . 
We are working with some provincial governments . 
Mr. Speaker , this question was fully answered last week . 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief ( Minister of Agriculture and Agri - Food , Lib . ) : 
How can we do proper safety maintenance with a slashed budget and ensure a peace of mind for our Sea King pilots and their families ? 
To the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
( c ) The RCMP does not collect statistics in this format . 
Here is where we talk about these expropriations . 
We need to be together on it . 
Politics normally stay out of the way if there are a good committee chair and good committee members like we have on our committee . 
Even if homeowners choose to pay unreasonable land rent , they know their homes are now rendered worthless . 
Archie took his advice . 
This is only a start. 
We cannot have that . 
The problem is that if it is not in the bill we cannot trust the word of anyone in this place . 
There were even petitions from women ' s groups saying that the bill was excellent and should be passed as written . 
It is obvious that if there is no specific guideline in Bill C - 49 with respect to the disposition of marital property , the courts will be at a loss to determine how they will resolve that issue , as they are now . 
The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of sex . 
It just needs a few amendments . 
Members 
Where does the government stand ? 
Mr. Randy White 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
Mr. Robert D . Nault 
Again it is pay more , get less . 
Mr. Speaker , something came up in the debate a few minutes ago . 
They might get good care but they would never be cured , nor would their disease ever be prevented. 
As the United Nations reminds us , we live in a country that for the sixth consecutive year has ranked number one in the world as the best place to live . 
That is a real commitment and those are the facts . 
It is these three ministers who will represent Quebec ' s interests . 
My own constituency of Fredericton has a significant IT industry employing thousands of engineers , computer programmers and others in the knowledge based industries , and that is growing every day . 
It does not provide all of the answers , but it takes a number of positive steps in the right direction . 
That is what they want us to remember about this budget . 
It will not happen at this rate . 
In the 1999 budget there is another $ 300 million for low income families and children . 
Mr. Speaker , before I was elected , I worked in a factory in the automotive industry . 
We were reminded by the Liberal fanfare of last year ' s budget that they had the education budget even though it accomplished precious little to actually improve the situation of students . 
The government rolled up its sleeves and presented to Canadians the state of our financial affairs . 
This health component of the budget reflects more than the amount itself . 
Mr. Speaker , the Parti Quebecois could not have found a worse ally to put the referendum issue back into the forefront . 
Mr. Speaker , since we have been the government we have managed the economy in a way that we have managed to reduce the deficit from $ 42 billion to zero . 
The minister keeps saying we will not fly unsafe aircraft but his words differ from his actions . 
TAXATION 
Hon. Jim Peterson ( Secretary of State ( International Financial Institutions ) , Lib . ) : 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
That is a five year period but even if a comparison with 1999 to last year is made , Canadians will still be paying more in taxes due to mammoth increases in CPP premiums and of course because of bracket creep . 
I am shocked and appalled at some of my hon. friends opposite who purport to know what wealth creation is all about . 
Leadership is all about dealing in hope . 
What did the pundits say last year ? 
Instead of interfereing in a jurisdiction that is not yours , namely health , what did you do ? 
This year ' s budget is an insult to the people of Quebec . 
This budget will increase that investment by an additional $ 200 million . 
At times our task seems impossible . 
Our armed forces totalled 120,000 personnel . 
These reforms would simplify the tax system and , combined with the elimination of marriage and child care penalties , will deliver thousands of dollars per year back into the pockets of the average Canadian family of four . 
Hon. Charles Caccia : 
Do hon. members believe in miracles ? 
A person who becomes sick needs 700 hours , and a newcomer on the workforce 910 hours . 
Finally , the vaccine we received was again tested on the orders of the U.S. defence department , in accordance with FDA directives . 
Mr. Preston Manning 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay 
Canada will miss him . 
He said they do not work as hard as parents who work outside the home , that their expenses are smaller , and that is why the Liberal government discriminates against them in the tax system . 
What is the scheme ? 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
We know of course that he is almost virtually everything around here , but he and the House should know that a good portion of what is in our estimates are the salaries of the employees of the other place . 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson ( Burnaby - Douglas , NDP ) : 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 I am honoured to present two petitions signed by residents of the Windsor and Grand Bend area . 
It is designed to encourage families and allow families to stay in the workforce . 
It comes as no surprise that Canadian families are not grateful . 
Second , broad based tax relief should focus initially on personal income taxes . 
If the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre is not satisfied with that , I can find another quote to settle her down . 
We are told " perhaps work can be done for other companies during down times '' . 
And then she hiked the Canada day budget by 500 % , 60 % of which was spent in Quebec . 
Reactions of my constituents on the whole through calls and through the mail are running about 70 % to 75 % in support of the budget . 
This budget is part of an overall plan , one which did not begin last year and one which will not end next year . 
The cuts have been felt everywhere but nowhere more than in the province of Saskatchewan . Our provincial government was forced to make very tough choices after 1995 . 
Mr. Speaker , I found it interesting that the member referred to the fact that the trick the Minister of Human Resources Development had discovered was to make the unemployed disappear . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for the question . 
I ask the member , if the government were truly concerned with productivity and jobs , would it not address the heavy tax burden that discourages needed business investment in this country ? 
I raised the issue of a Windsor individual who was asked to leave the hospital after tonsil surgery , bleeding and vomiting . 
Mr. Paul Szabo 
Mr. Antoine Dub é 
Amendment 
The government made policy changes in its last budget to increase the child care tax deduction , one of the principal offending elements of the tax code in this respect , by increasing it over the last and current fiscal years . 
In fact , too long , I would suggest . 
In its previous budget of 1998 it actually increased the amount of money that can be claimed for child care expenses in an institutional day care . 
Mr. Speaker , I understand that the hon. member has a great interest in this particular issue . 
Billions of dollars have been cut from social spending since the Liberals came to power and increased targeting of programs has meant that some children are deemed more worthy than others . 
The tax system should not encourage , in our opinion , either stay at home parenting or the utilization of a day care system or an alternative system . 
In a lot of cases it is women , but not in all cases . 
I am sure all hon. members of the House would agree that the motion and the debate today are not just about taxation but also about the family . 
There are single income families that have no choice about going to work . 
Hon. members across the way may scoff , but they scoff because they are ignorant of the issue . 
The constituency association drafted a resolution and submitted it to the policy making process of the Reform Party assembly . 
We should not make judgmental calls on people ' s choices . 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his question . 
He has a 10 minute speech and has a minute left in his time . 
Minister Rock also announced the government ' s support of $ 2 million for Rick Hansen ' s neuro - trauma research which will benefit Canadians with spinal cord injuries . 
This sounds more like a speech to a partisan sovereignist group than a speech by a government . 
They are the ones who have called women a special interest group for a long time . 
Oh , oh . 
The hon. member for L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re . 
I have proposed some reforms to the Senate and we voted for some reforms to the Senate . 
We are right now , with the provincial government , looking at how we can possibly use this program to help the older workers who participate in the program . 
None of us should question that . 
My husband is the single income earner . 
The tax system should accommodate the cost of child rearing whether or not both parents are working outside the home . 
Now we have to make the decision of should I withdraw from the workforce and provide direct parental care or should I engage care and have a child care expense deduction . 
That is misrepresenting my statement . 
Grandparents who would like to see their grandchildren are unable to do that . 
I am appalled. 
After 22 years of practising law , I have frequently been asked questions with respect to the Income Tax Act . 
It turned out that this Mr. Martin was one of the architects of the Liberal platform for 1993 . He said on the phone to me " I understand that you don ' t agree with the Liberal platform '' . 
What have the officials the minister asked to look into this issue last year been doing ? 
Therefore , I am pleased to say that I intend to amend the motion . 
Members of the Reform Party have presented different positions to us and they are certainly going through a great deal of soul searching about where they stand on this issue . 
Basically what it is saying is that it does work under controlled circumstances . 
The burden of proof will be on government regulators at HPB to prove that the products are harmful . 
THE SENATE 
Bill C - 481 . 
In Bill C - 49 we have included the requirement that the land codes must include the opportunity and the reality in the provisions for matrimonial property to implemented. 
The time provided by unanimous consent for questions and comments has expired. 
Nothing precludes a community from addressing the issue at the beginning of the land code development process . 
Mr. Speaker , following his historic radio addresses of the second world war , Winston Churchill often commented that he was never comfortable with the notion that he inspired his nation . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , again the hon. member simply does not seem to get it . 
Equality of transfers per person simply does not translate into equality of available services . 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , is the finance minister for real ? 
Thanks for the endorsement of Mr. Limoges . 
FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
For that reason , regrettably - and I say regrettably very sincerely - we could not support Bill C - 49 . 
The member for Vancouver Quadra has stated that Bill C - 49 was poorly drafted. 
I believe that for the purposes of expediency and to make sure with the 30 minutes we have remaining that both the NDP and PC parties have an opportunity to get on the record , that the member currently speaking for the Bloc Quebecois will speak not longer than 20 minutes . 
Mr. Speaker , it was the government that invoked time allocation on this legislation . 
Let me explain why . 
These comments were gathered by my colleague from Acadie - Bathurst who visited 20 cities from coast to coast to coast listening to what Canadians have to say about the changes in the unemployment insurance system and the theft of the UI fund by this government . 
They were not enough . 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN ' S DAY 
Mr. Derek Lee 
Third reading 
Fair enough . 
By splitting our vote the Reform Party almost sacrificed the free trade agreement . 
That is what is killing their businesses and driving their commodity prices down more than anything else . 
People were threatened with criminal fines and sanctions .

YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
I will permit her to answer the question if she wants to . 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Keith Martin ( Esquimalt - Juan de Fuca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I want to start by thanking the hon. member for his interest . 
He did recommend a waste management authority that would be in the nature of a federal crown corporation . 
A letter was also sent to all francophone clients to inform them of this move . 
The House resumed consideration of Bill C - 55 , an act respecting advertising services supplied by foreign periodical publishers , as reported ( with amendment ) from the committee ; and of Group No. 1 . 
The scale of our market , the competition for readers from American magazines , and the negative impact on our advertising revenues of the spillover advertising that Canadians see in American magazines have all meant that Canadian publishers will survive only if they produce quality magazines that Canadians want to read and at the same time operate at peak efficiency . 
But are we just to turn around and say that we do not care that what they are doing is in our opinion illegal activity that is damaging an industry ? 
I certainly concur with that view . 
Let us make sure they are worth fighting for . 
I think really it is a point of debate . 
One other item that is also important is something I jotted down from a conversation with a constituent who spoke about the fact that the bill does not place restrictions on the content of magazines or on individual advertisements or limits Canadians ' access to foreign magazines . 
It is not just the Canadian steel producers . 
Since Confederation Canada has preserved , promoted and enhanced cultural identity through mass media . 
We have to stand up against that . 
It is an important bill , a bill that is especially important to the province of British Columbia which suffers under a socialist government . 
Mr. Speaker , I vote no on this motion . 
If we do not get the right decision on April 26 to 29 on this appeal we could then be waiting a lot longer for a supreme court ruling . 
They are the criteria that Devco ' s collective agreements indicate shall apply to the early retirement incentive program for any further workforce reductions . 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay 
Mr. Jason Kenney 
Mr. Speaker , as the member of parliament for London - Fanshawe , it is a pleasure , pursuant to Standing Order 36 , to present several petitions from my constituents and other people from the London area and district . 
The third change is that improvements will be made in the measurement of the ability of provinces to raise revenues on their own . 
I do not think if my friends across the way were pushed on this could argue that some of the new expenditures are priorities . 
We also believe it is time to begin finding ways to reinvest in our justice system . 
What a glorious statement to hold up to describe what being a Canadian is all about . 
The New Democratic Party . 
For a province like Newfoundland , which has seen a significant exodus of people over the past several years and it is predicted to continue for the foreseeable future , it is grossly unfair and inconsistent with the principles of equalization . 
It is not by getting a greater number of provinces to pay for a smaller number that the Reform Party will increase its chances of winning the next election . 
I do not know whether this is going to be misunderstood , but I do not want power at all . 
We want to find out what are their true legitimate grievances and to solve them . 
Is it necessary to try to accomplish that ? 
I find it interesting the member would bring in the issue of immigrants from Hong Kong and from Taiwan who have come to Canada . 
In addition , the per capita transfer for the three contributing provinces was reduced. 
I also assure her that I believe what I will read right now . 
I would suggest that even the hon. member who thinks Mr. McKenna does not know what he is talking about would spend her money more effectively than if she gave it to the premier of New Brunswick , the Prime Minister of Canada or any other politician or bureaucrat . 
We want to bring the individual into the equalization formula and make sure that we have a macro measure so that we do not have one region competing with another region , one region lording it over another region so that no one benefits . 
Senator Petten was instrumental in extending Canada ' s marine jurisdiction beyond 200 miles to the great advantage of his home province of Newfoundland and to all Canadians . 
Most important , community residents themselves got together and worked hard to ensure the continuation of this great theatre company . 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
By forcing Liberal MPs to vote for tax discrimination tonight , the Prime Minister is sending a shot across the bow of this Liberal dominated committee : don ' t you dare think for yourselves . 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Speaker , in my judgment the system works very well , but I will look , if it is needed. 
It is so typical that very complex issues are always misunderstood by the people on the other side of the House . 
It is a formula that is supposed to create equality in Canada . 
It is outrageous to think that a minister of the crown can so blatantly ignore the office of the auditor general. 
When I see the bill in front of the House today talking about equalization , I cheer . 
We establish a baseline where those provinces that are making less and have less than the other provinces are supported , as well they should . 
California had a problem . 
Rather , the intervention has to take place on the basis of the need of the people , not on the basis of the fact that we want to somehow equalize all the provinces . 
The argument is that this approach will increase Ontario ' s fiscal capacity and therefore benefit equalization payments to recipient provinces . 
Madam Speaker , I thank the hon. member for his comments and his question . 
That is a big mistake . 
PAIRED 
If we are to provide that level of responsibility to the volunteer sector we have to provide with it some type of commensurate improvement in the tax treatment which would enable citizens to contribute to those worthy areas . 
One problem that arises from this is that we now have a deputy minister and others who by the role of regulation and interpretation can determine which organization qualifies for the indirect subsidy and which one does not . 
We are working within those responsibilities , in this case with the Government of Saskatchewan , to address those compensation issues . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien

Second reading 
Mr. Speaker , Montreal is the home of McGill University , an outstanding national and international world - renowned educational institution . 
That is our position . 
Does the Prime Minister intend to personally benefit from that lease , or will he do the right thing and take that clause out of the lease ? 
Mr. Speaker , I am really delighted the hon. member raised the issue of the work that has been done by the member for Mississauga South and a number of other members on this side of the House . 
They promised a $ 3 billion cut to equalization payments between six provinces to have - 
Mr. Scott Brison ( Kings - Hants , PC ) : 
I would like to table those documents if I might . 
The hon. member is reading . 
Mr. David Chatters ( Athabasca , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Grant McNally : 
The federal government can intervene in provincial jurisdiction with the authority of the provinces . 
That is the fundamental purpose of government . 
All provinces and all politicians have good and bad examples . 
The government should add the ability to add a PST to the other criteria on the list for equalization payments . 
There is an interesting twist on this . 
I am sure we are all familiar with Columbia House Records . 
This is a misguided view because the Senate was playing its constitutionally mandated role to review legislation from the House . 
This could be a half billion dollar investment in the economic future of Halifax . 
In acting on the panel ' s recommendations the government also moved to resolve Ethyl ' s NAFTA claim . 
Pay Equity 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton 
NATIONAL HOUSING ACT 
This private member ' s bill will dedicate August 14 each year in Canada as the national day against impaired driving . 
Agreed. 
As the war progressed many of the sailors had sustained injuries and many had lost a friend or two , if not their entire crew . 
But all this show does not , when it comes down to the nitty - gritty , do much for the merchant marine veterans . 
I have a copy in my office and when I watched the video it truly brought tears to my eyes . 
The minister was pleased to lead this group of entrepreneurs and officials , successfully opening doors to Canadian exporters in this important Latin American market . 
It goes so far as to put itself under the same kind of guidelines and provisions that OSFI imposes upon other financial institutions , particularly federally registered trust companies , banks and so on . 
They have the pride of ownership , the involvement and this is a good thing . 
What does a reverse equity mortgage mean ? 
The CMHC lends the rest of the money . 
I am sure he will fondly recall going door to door in the riding of Sherbrooke , which resulted in a resounding victory for us . 
With respect to this bill , there are some concrete steps the government could take to deal effectively with the problems of inadequate housing . 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Today is a very bad day . 
Paycheques are cut in less than half in this country . 
NATIONAL KIDNEY MONTH 
Mr. Stan Dromisky 
There is probably no better place where that guidance should be applied than in the government ' s law on magazine publications . 
In short , Canadian content . 
What is really going on at the political level is a gigantic game of chicken . 
The connection between our trade figures and our employment figures could not be clearer . 
This constitutes a violation of their basic and fundamental human rights . 
Statistics Canada has reported that national unemployment is only 7.8 % , which is an all - time low since 1990 . 
CULTURAL DIVERSITY 
Mr. Speaker , as regards Quebec ' s president of the bar , I cannot wait to see the reaction of the committee of the Barreau du Qu é bec , which examined the issue and contradicted the president of the bar . 
FOREST INDUSTRY 
HIGHWAYS 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
The Deputy Speaker : 
- between 94 % and 97 % of screen time in Canadian theatres ; in fact , it is here that the situation is worst , for Hollywood studios have always treated Canada as though it were part of the American market . 
These have implications in terms of funding for culture , technology , issues of trade liberalization , globalization , demographics and the role of the federal government . 
We can stand firm '' . 
No. 
In other words , negative option billing enables the large companies to have greater power over their smaller counterparts. 
Bill C - 393 deals only with commercial and economic aspects without any consideration for other cultural , political and social aspects . 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish ( Mississauga Centre , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Richard Marceau 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay 
Pensions 
I have used the words simple and minor to describe the content and the construction of the actual legislation . 
The effect of the bill is to give the crown an election as to whether to proceed against the responsible person as an indictable offence or as a summary offence . 
They actually have break and enter rings where they divide up neighbourhoods . 
The politics of the Young Offenders Act that are played out by the extreme right wing make it very difficult to put in place thoughtful amendments such as the one the member is putting forth today . 
There is no doubt that the main problem for Quebec and for Canada during this transition period is exports . 
In my opinion the amendment is in order . 
The record of many other countries in the hemisphere is by no means as good as Canada ' s . 
There are a number of countries which are being denied entry to the European Union because their economy is not strong . 
I feel a little reluctant to say that we will vote against this motion because debate is often helpful and useful , but if we totally disagree with the premise of the reason for having the debate and completely disagree with the reason to proceed with even considering a North American currency , why would we ? 
To relentlessly pursue one element of globalization , a common North American currency , without dealing head on with the issues that have consistently hurt our Canadian dollar , productivity issues such as taxation , interprovincial trade barriers and the regulatory burden in Canada , would be naive . 
The question is this : are we going to isolate ourselves from major world trends , or are we going to start right now looking at the pros and cons of changing the way we do things . 
A few days ago hundreds of unarmed students pushed back Israeli forces that had annexed the village of Arnoun . 
Mr. David Price ( Compton - Stanstead , PC ) : 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe ( Laurier - Sainte - Marie , BQ ) : 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
YOUNG OFFENDERS ACT 
Mr. Jim Jones ( Markham , PC ) : 
For the purposes of this section , the reasons for convening such a meeting shall be stated in the request . 
( Motions deemed adopted , bill read the first time and printed ) 
Mr. Speaker , I thank the member for Drummond for her excellent question . 
The situation here is exactly the same . 
We all know that it is not a hen , it is actually an eagle . 
However , today ' s motion calls for a committee to consider a pan - American currency . 
These figures do not include Mexico. 
Money still conveys that image . 
We acknowledge that that is a big issue . 
We need to have dramatic net tax relief . 
There is no magic bullet to fixing this problem . 
It seems to be in the interests of members of the opposition to stand up and denigrate Canadians right across this land . 
I point out that for years Panama ' s currency has been at par with the US dollar . 
Personally , I support the creation of a common currency , as do my colleague from Charlesbourg and our leader . 
Some hon. members : 
( The House divided on the motion , which was agreed to on the following division : ) 
We were shocked and appalled as were many Canadians across this country , especially Canadians who are facing enormous difficulties gaining access to quality health care services . 
Mr. Richard M. Harris 
Mr. Eric Lowther 
Motion No. 2 
Whereas ongoing UN sanctions against Iraq regarded as the most stringent ever imposed by the United Nations have devastated the Iraq economy and resulted in the deaths of over one million civilians , many of them children , and whereas article 2 of the United Nations charter states that " all member states shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace , security , and justice , are not endangered '' , the petitioners call upon the Parliament of Canada to strongly appeal to the United Nations , to the United States and to Britain for a rejection of any further military action against Iraq . 
We will also hear of the intransigence of the Liberal government and its failure to deal with consecutive sentencing , despite a private member ' s bill by one of its own MPs calling for change . 
In a recently released RCMP intelligence report British Columbia is identified as the only province where child pornography is a serious concern for law enforcement agencies . 
It is a bad bill and should be changed. 
Mr. Speaker , I noticed that the member focused all his attention on the 10 % plus of violent offenders and that aspect of the new legislation . 
It is sad that the great majority of young people in custody are there for non - violent offences for which community approaches will do a much better job of promoting social values such as responsibility and accountability . 
Quebec ' s president of the bar represents his peers . 
They relate to what we all know so sadly as fetal alcohol syndrome which affects the aboriginal population in a statistically high way . 
In order to replace that natural rate of attrition a certain number of recruits must be going through the system . 
The societal costs of conditional sentencing are mounting . 
The government fully understands the importance of providing Canadians with an environment in which they feel safe . 
That same opposition party said that if it had the opportunity it would cut aboriginal community programs by $ 800 million . 
There has been precious little in the way of justice coming from the government . 
Is my friend one of the people supporting this initiative ? 
The statistics are these . 
Could the member provide some rationale as to why we have a presumptive transfer for murder , manslaughter , aggravated sexual assault and attempted murder , and yet nowhere do we see anything on the presumptive transfer side for sexual assault with a weapon or any firearms related offences which are very serious crimes ? 
The four researchers chosen by their peers to fill these chairs will be conducting research in such important areas as cardiovascular health , endocrinology and mental health . 
Mr. Claude Bachand ( Saint - Jean , BQ ) : 
* * * 
Number two , 60 % of Canadians - 
Hon. Hedy Fry ( Secretary of State ( Multiculturalism ) ( Status of Women ) , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the government has done its very best to convince us that changes made to part 1 of the Canada Labour Code would ensure the unimpeded flow of Canadian grain to port on time . 
Agreed. 
Does he feel our judicial system right now is enforcing the penalties that are there ? 
This is an aggravated form of assault on the property and home of residents . 
Canada is a nation that was built on immigration . 
We have to look at the drug situation which is terrible . 
There are some common solutions to the problem . 
Their average IQ is 68 . 
I think this is a serious situation . 
I would like to use these last few moments to add a couple of points to what has already been put on the table . 
Mr. John Nunziata : 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Andr é Harvey : 
( Clause 5 agreed to ) 
The Speaker : 
They are based on gender and class. 
She made the point that this is a women ' s issue and I immediately remember reading the paper put out by the justice department . 
This is an extremely useful exercise . 
Do we hear about that from the government ' s spin doctors ? 
The purpose of this process was to solicit names for user representatives of Canada port authority boards and to forward nominations to the Minister of Transport for consideration . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT , 1999 
Indeed , the very ceiling of the House of Commons is fine hand - painted Irish linen . 
We have taken a country that was bankrupt and have managed to put its finances in good order while at the same time keeping a safety net that all Canadians can be proud of . 
The minister said that this study had been ordered because effective and integrated highways are vital to Canada ' s economic well - being . 
Mr. Antoine Dub é ( L é vis - et - Chutes - de - la - Chaudi è re , BQ ) : 
How can the government continue to justify policy that sends young Canadians out of this country , that puts small businesses into bankruptcy , that takes hope away from Canadians who are working hard ? 
Mr. Jay Hill ( Prince George - Peace River , Ref. ) : 
This is one of the key foundations that has allowed us to make new investments for a stronger economy and society and at the same time provide broad based tax relief while remaining deficit free . 
Even the actions in the legislation by themselves reflect the commitment to a balanced approach in budget planning and budget making which has been the hallmark of the government since coming to office . 
It is an economic tragedy . 
Her husband James decided to put his career on hold . 
Some hon. members : 
The new mandate of the Canadian institute for health information will be to file periodic reports on the health of Canadians and the health system , including waiting lists , doctor and specialist assignments and the most effective courses of treatment . 
I want to talk for a moment about a fundamental problem that exists in this House , with this government , with this parliament and in this country . 
The Minister of Finance is determining health care policy in this great country . 
Mr. Nelson Riis : 
She was wrong . 
Mr. Speaker , far be it for me to respond to the hon. members opposite , but if anyone does not know what they are talking about it is the hon. member ' s party on the other side . 
Let me deal with another statement . 
Many lost their lives and their health for our country . 
Mr. Peter Adams 
Hon. John Manley 
Mr. John Williams 
Hon. Martin Cauchon ( Secretary of State ( Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec ) , Lib . ) : ( a ) April 15 , 1988 . 
There is no doubt that every member in this House and all Canadians would agree that there is a need to continually upgrade knowledge and skills . 
It has been proven that lower taxation leads to higher revenues . 
However over the years they have paid a lot of income tax and a lot of other taxes . 
But this year , in 1999 , surpluses will reach $ 26 billion . 
Would she have more money to put food on the table ? 
I am asking him a question . 
This is like the Kmart or Zellers or Wal - Mart approach to economic development . 
It is very important to know that personal income tax revenue has increased primarily and exclusively because more Canadians are working . 
Madam Speaker , as usual I found the emissions from this member to be rather interesting , particularly the commercial for the CA group , when he himself , this Liberal of great high esteem , admitted very freely that to file one ' s income tax is a complicated matter . 
It is a farce because at the end of this debate there will be a vote and there is no way we will be able to reverse what the finance minister announced on February 24 , 1998 . We know that , because government members are forced to vote for these measures . 
Madam Speaker , I would like to ask my colleague about one of the saddest things I have seen since being elected to the House of Commons . 
This makes no sense . 
He is an economist by profession and I have heard him speak very well on a number of very complicated issues with regard to the economic condition in Canada . 
Because he wanted to attack this same notion of principal focal point , which our party had raised a few days before . 
Mr. Speaker , Canada ' s standard of living is falling . 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
TRANSITIONAL JOBS FUND 
Mr. Speaker , as the minister stated earlier this week , we regret any disruption to services to Canadians as a result of the rotating PSAC strike . 
We all know conditions are deplorable in first nation communities . 
The Speaker : 
The Deputy Speaker : 
That was the Liberal solution , not ours . 
Scandinavian countries used part of the commission ' s report to make reforms . 
That is something which we in Canada need to take a cold hard look at . 
I would like to ask my hon. colleague whether he thinks that type of Liberal taxation and Liberal fairness is justice in taxation . 
As a result , the last budget was good news for post - secondary education . 
Canadians through extra taxes balanced the budget . 
It has lightened our wallets by $ 275 million . 
I am pleased that Bill S - 20 will bring the act into line with the modern reality of the corporation . 
While we all hope this dispute will be resolved in a timely fashion , we cannot allow an ongoing disruption of Canada ' s grain flow as that would constitute a further attack on producers ' falling incomes . 
When the government negotiates , it has a basic goal in mind . 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau : - the right to bargain , to have a union . 
This is not the first time Canadian farmers have been affected by grain delays . 
I say that because I think the very fact of making final offer selection arbitration available to these parties will make them bargain very earnestly . 
The pressure was on by the Public Service Alliance of Canada . 
People in Quebec , Ontario and eastern Canada would be more concerned about the grain issue if they had their share of the transportation market . 
Neither railway is lifting cars for Vancouver . 
For the sake of the future of the grain industry , Canadian exports , Canadian farmers and all Canadians , we must reach a settlement as soon as possible to avoid further job losses and financial disaster . 
When we get disruptions in the grain handling system we pay very dearly because over 80 % of what we produce is shipped out of the country . 
To understand this strike one must understand what regional rates of pay are , why the government wants to maintain them and what would be the implications of accepting the union ' s demand for uniform national rates of pay . 
Isn ' t that a friendly disposition . 
They had shut down the entire American transportation infrastructure . 
The only answer we received was the one this afternoon in question period . 
He did a wonderful job . 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano 
Mr. Serge Cardin 
The only way to establish a foreign bank in Canada is by establishing a subsidiary , not a branch , and presently the minimum deposit is $ 10 million . 
In the last 20 years the number of banks in the country has diminished.

Mr. Bill Blaikie ( Winnipeg - Transcona , NDP ) : 
Mr. Grant McNally ( Dewdney - Alouette , Ref. ) : 
* * * 
We have been looking at arbitration but as the member knows arbitration was suspended by law in 1996 . 
Mr. Gilles Bernier ( Tobique - Mactaquac , PC ) : 
4 . During consideration of the said bill , no division shall be deferred. 
All players should be able to start at the same time . 
They will not provide better services in small towns of Canada or in the suburbs of our cities . 
Once again , should we have foreign banks ? 
He can usually live with his frustration . 
The guarantees they want are incredible . 
I remind the NDP member that one the candidates for the Conservative Party leadership , Mr. Orchard , raised that issue and often said " To regain our sovereignty '' . 
Equipping those in the system with the tools to make decisions based on the facts of the case in front of them is a key direction of the new legislation . 
I do want to be clear about our concerns on the impact this bill , if it were approved , would have on some families in terms of their ability to provide the resources and supervision required under this bill and generally under section 7.2 of the act . 
I would like to respond to what she said about the child welfare and mental health systems being all that we need to look after 10 and 11 year olds caught up in the criminal justice system . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe 
Gasoline Additives 
In response to concerns by the law enforcement community , judges would be given more discretion to admit voluntary statements by youth as evidence at their trials . 
When going through the proposed legislation clause by clause we found for the most part that it was the old Young Offenders Act rewritten and presented in a different format . 
Impressing upon both the parent and the young person the serious repercussions for violating the agreement will protect members of our communities . 
Then there is the overriding principle that these young persons are to be rehabilitated. 
By passing Bill C - 37 at that time , the Liberal government was introducing into the Young Offenders Act a whole series of automatic provisions which would greatly affect the fragile equilibrium of the youth justice system . 
While there was progressive legislation in place and a call for community groups to deal with young offenders , without adequate financing , those young offenders went to jail because that was all the judiciary could do with them . 
Unfortunately in the race to balance books , in the race to cut deficit , in the race to the bottom we have increased child poverty in this country by 50 % . 
This minister , like her predecessor , still appears to assign a low priority to victims ' rights in relation to the rights granted to persons accused or convicted of crimes , which reminds me of a story . 
I do not believe that sent out the right message . 
And I hope I do not have another incident like the one last week . 
I am very glad he was able to work that out . 
Mr. Speaker , I would like to pay particular tribute to Major Lionel Guy D ' Artois , a national hero , who became famous around the world during more than 30 years of service with the Canadian armed forces . 
On March 9 the PC caucus along with the opposition members voted in favour of this motion . 
The fourth criteria was how it would work as an embassy . 
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Mr. Jason Kenney ( Calgary Southeast , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Maurice Dumas ( Argenteuil - Papineau - Mirabel , BQ ) : 
The Speaker : 
They disregarded the farmers in this country who are already suffering from a serious financial situation due in no part to their own actions or decision making . 
Let us look at the government ' s previous history with respect to labour negotiations . 
We believe the freedom to unionize exists in Canada for employees and employers . 
We would be happy to point out some of the inconsistencies so that perhaps the Liberal government could correct some of them . 
It is almost inconceivable . 
It is a pay equity issue , not dealing with gender this time but with geography . 
We recognize that there are serious implications when the trade of that agricultural commodity is impacted. 
I have in my riding a number of PSAC union members who work at the base in Dundurn for the Department of National Defence . 
The member is correct that this government has faltered quite seriously in its negotiation processes with the unions . 
Another very serious concern is that , for these negotiations , the government has suspended these workers ' right to arbitration . 
This is an age - old trick : divide to conquer . 
Can the member see any reason , either in practicality or in law , why the government could not have brought in targeted legislation to keep the grain moving for the benefit of the western Canadian economy without involving thousands of other unionized workers who have absolutely nothing to do with the principal crisis that has caused us to be debating this today ? 
In Quebec , we have workers who have paid EI premiums for 25 or 30 years . 
The PCC will prepare a report at the end of the hearings and will publish the conclusions and recommendations of the committee . 
Motion that debate be not further adjourned 
Hon. John Manley 
Mr. Speaker , pursuant to Standing Order 36 ( 8 ) , I have the honour to table , in both official languages , the government ' s response to five petitions . 
At the same time we believe certain services in Canada should not be interrupted because it would have a detrimental effect on the country ' s economy and innocent third parties would be damaged by the removal of those services . 
Farmers themselves understand the difficulties faced by these labour unions . 
He goes on to say : 
That will not fly well in the next election , that we have allowed the system to deteriorate to a point where everything needs fixing . 
Now it is changing it to imposing a collective agreement . 
If government members think that moving the picket line from outside to inside the workplace will make everyone happy , they are sadly mistaken . 
In Newfoundland we have a most unfortunate situation now where we have taken the right to strike away from our policemen and firemen . 
When this country gets to know the full story , it will be anti - government . 
We in Quebec have the fine motto of " Je me souviens '' , and we certainly do not forget . 
If a third party is being hurt by a strike of this magnitude , something has to be done . 
This procedure would ensure the continuous flow of grain to market . 
On this day I wish my mother a very happy birthday . 
These regional rates are unfair to 11,000 workers in Canada , including 1,500 in the maritime provinces . 
The words are now getting a little bit closer . 
Why should cities like Windsor and Sarnia be exposed to risk ? 
Mr. Speaker , Canadians are getting a little sick and tired of the little guy from Shawinigan - 
I asked my trustee to administer the debt for me and so far , so good . 
I wish I could be optimistic and say that at all times all members keep to the rules and are very quiet . 
On the other hand , people are being forced to live in an environment where the cost of living is higher than in another . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to rise today to speak to this debate . 
Mr. Myron Thompson : 
Mr. Richard Marceau : 
It means the right to picket . 
Senators are going to debate the issue whereas , in this House , we will not , although we are the only elected chamber , and willing to do it . 
What is the President of the Treasury Board doing ? 
This is democracy according to the government . 
What has been said in the House is wrong . 
The debate we are having today is very important . 
What we have here is a motion by the member for Regina - Qu ' Appelle . 
It will inevitably reform the IMF , the World Bank and the Tobin tax taken in juxtaposition . 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT , 1999 
I answered " Naturally , it is a matter of equity '' . 
Because they work in poor regions , these public servants are paid less . 
In 1982 , it passed Bill C - 124 to freeze the salaries of some 500,000 workers . 
It is important for Canadians to understand that workers are fighting for them . 
They are not surprised by the rotating strikes by PSAC members . 
This is called the right to strike . 
I am not telling the government to start giving unions everything they ask for . 
On March 12 , 1999 the talks ended without reaching a settlement . 
Since these folks are too lazy to be here over the Easter break , they have decided to legislate them back to work before they even hit the bricks to save time and energy . 
It is totally unfair that women working in the public service still have to fight today for fundamental rights to justice and pay equity . 
The only solution is for the government to bargain in good faith . 
When we formed our own staff association , we said one of the things that we were going to solve right at the beginning was the problem of dispute resolution . 
We are dealing with a motion concerning the disposition of a bill regarding the resumption of government services . 
It is an old Polish custom , but I was reminded of it when I heard the eloquent speeches opposite of how members were barred from coming to parliament . 
All those opposed will please say nay . 
Mr. Jim Gouk 
If that is not the case , I would like the minister to - 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
Members will have to continue without the agreement . 
I suggest that there is enough evidence before the House for the Chair to make a ruling on this matter . 
You said you would come back to him in debate . 
I rise on a point of order , Mr. Speaker . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Everybody seems to want to know what was in the tentative agreement . 
Workers can take some comfort that even though they got a lower wage they had job security . 
Perhaps he also cannot remember why he claimed that he was going to rip up the GST and the free trade agreement . 
Mr. Chairman , basically under the agreement there are two groups that are covered , table two , the blue collar workers , and table four , the CXs , the correctional workers . 
Mr. Chairman , I have a couple of questions . 
Hon. Marcel Mass é : 
We have no problem recruiting prison guards . 
That is not the emergency . 
Hon. Marcel Mass é : 
I guess I am asking for some explanation . 
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment ? 
Some hon. members : 
Some hon. members : 
Agreed. 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea . 
I do not think the government bothered reading that letter too much because it went ahead with its negotiating plan which resulted in the mess we see here today . 
One last attempt to put in final offer selection arbitration will be made . 
This is the only real concern of the government . 
And the screams of the obscure backbenchers will not change a thing . 
No doubt many people are happy with this government , the people that are in the top 1 % income bracket who run the corporations and own the banks that give such huge donations to the Liberal Party every year . 
It could have crushed it just like that , without any offer from the workers . 
Had it bargained honestly and openly in the beginning , an agreement could have been reached with the workers . 
Why should people support it ? 
Mr. Charlie Power 
BUILDING CONTRACTS 
Mr. R é al M é nard 
GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
Mr. Dale Johnston : 
It was going to end up hurting people waiting for income tax returns . 
It is not that the railways are ineffective in moving this stuff . 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased to speak this morning to Bill C - 76 . 
That is a basic fact . 
Did the government bring in legislation to order them to pay that money back to the Canadian coffers ? 
I know there is tremendous concern for our international trade reputation . 
It is 40 pages . 
What about the members here ? 
For the government to suddenly come up with legislation to order them all back to work when this has been going on for more than six weeks just shows that it had the opportunity to do something and it did nothing . 
It is really ridiculous , as I explained previously , to blame the Reform Party for holding this up . 
Mr. Speaker , I wish the hon. member ' s mother a happy birthday . 
Mr. Speaker , during the Semaine qu é b é coise de la d é ficience intellectuelle , from March 14 to 20 , Quebeckers were urged to forget their biases toward mentally impaired people . 
Order . 
We are simply testing to see if we can make a contribution to that issue . 
The trustee was not to be paid by Duhaime but to be paid by the one who was buying the shares . 
The debt that was owed to me by somebody else was in the hands of a blind trust . 
The Speaker : 
Right now there are obligations for people in various jobs to participate . 
I was present while she stayed in the Chamber . 
We asked the government over and over again to bring in such things as final arbitration that would put an end to the harassment that farmers have to go through . 
I think something is not working . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
An hon. member : 
Yes , you are . 
He refused even to consider passing such a bill , although it improved union - management relations tremendously in Quebec . 
What we in the Bloc Quebecois want is for the government and table 2 and 4 workers to come to an agreement , and for citizens to regain access to the services they are entitled to . 
They boasted , saying " We would never do that . 
A while ago , my colleague mentioned investments in financial markets , they are not value - added. 
Everybody who deals in the market , whether it is the money market or any other market , is quite willing to pay the transaction fee which accrues to the dealers . 
Canada has an opportunity to demonstrate on the world stage that we are concerned with the countries that are having a hard time . 
The senators did not have to go on strike . 
Throughout the day , for hours on end , I had to fight with other members so that the hon. member for Mercier could finish the speech she spent a whole weekend preparing and which summarized the testimony heard in the past two or three weeks . 
I cannot say the same for the government . 
The blue collar workers have not had a salary increase in years , but the workload has increased because a number of jobs have been cut . 
Promises are things of the past . 
It merely adds to the problems in the long term . 
But those people who have not had a negotiated agreement in seven or eight years , how do they feel today ? 
The NDP and the Bloc Quebecois have strong union ties . 
This thing is dead because the process is being held up by 13 % . 
This bill undermines the democratic rights of Canadian workers . 
They were prepared to accept that and live with that even though it represented a significant compromise on their behalf . 
It was a little over a year ago that we had a problem at Christmastime when the post office workers were no longer willing to work without a contract because their contract had expired. 
There was a time line for arranging for meetings . 
We are opposed because they take away the right of parliament to fully debate an issue . 
But are they effectively to be immunized from this equality before the law because they cannot be served ? 
I declare the motion carried. 
A bit of discussion with the House leaders before announcing it would have made all the difference in proceeding smoothly tonight and getting on with this business of getting the workers back on the job . 
Given some of the commotion that was taking place at the time he made the request , I would again ask for unanimous consent that the minister be permitted to take questions for a defined period , 10 minutes or more . 
Mr. Gerald Keddy : 
Is that agreed ? 
That is very germane to the issue at hand . 
Is there consent ? 
I do not think this is any way to negotiate with employees , whether you are a staunch union person or not . 
There is nothing outrageous about such a measure , on the contrary . 
There is an aspect that this government seems to completely overlook , and that is what happens the day after workers have been forced to go back to work . 
It is getting to be more and more common . 
There are examples . 
He mentioned in the House that he has an agreement in principle . 
Mr. Preston Manning ( Leader of the Opposition , Ref. ) : 
We cannot send people back to work who are not out on strike and we should not be voting for something like that tonight . 
Mr. Jim Gouk : 
Mr. Chairman , we believe it is in the public interest of Canadians , because of the emergencies that exist , to have back to work legislation that will prevent strikes as of now . 
There are some initials on it but they really do not have to abide by anything . 
Mr. Chairman , we will look at these possibilities . 
( Clause 3 agreed to ) 
Shall clause 7 , as amended , carry ? 
( a ) the day they become bound by a collective agreement concluded by the employer and the bargaining agent , and 
( 3 ) The terms and conditions prescribed under subsections ( 1 ) to ( 2.3 ) 
Shall schedule 2 carry ? 
Back in 1993 when the Liberals took over as a majority government , many workers across the country were in a wage freeze . 
I have not exactly had time to look into this , but I am giving the government notice tonight that I intend to look into it and determine just what it was that managed to have our local school boards not be able to win any of these contracts . 
It can never be overstated that we are dealing here with a type of behavior that is deeply rooted in ideology . 
When they were in opposition , they could not find words strong enough to condemn those abuses and it was quite something to see them praising the values of dialogue , commitment and negotiation . 
We know that you cannot count on the ministers , and I do not pay them tribute . 
There is a terrible unconstitutional law that has been implemented by Treasury Board . 
In conclusion , I will say that the government used the House of Commons to force employees back to work and to threaten them to the very last minute , and when the employees signed the agreement , the government decided to go ahead with its strategy , just the same . 
Yet the government has continued to arrest people and to take them to court over regulations that are invalid , regulations which a provincial court judge and the Supreme Court of British Columbia have declared invalid.

THE ECONOMY 
Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that this appointment , occurring as it does two days before an important conference on the homeless in Toronto is nothing more than a publicity stunt intended to camouflage his inaction to date in this matter ? 
QUESTION PERIOD 
I am here because I believe in this country . 
Certainly there are significant risks in taking this military action , risks to the lives of Canadian service people and to the lives of civilians in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo itself . 
With respect to grants or loans awarded by the federal government for building restoration , such as awards made under infrastructure and regional development programs , in each of the last five years , 1994 , 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , and 1998 : ( a ) how many have been awarded ; ( b ) what specifically have they been for ; ( c ) what was the geographic location ; ( d ) what was the amount of each award , including whether or not it was on a matching basis ; and ( e ) under which federal department or program was each award made ? 
The government could make a lot of changes that would allow credit unions to expand and to serve Canadian consumers ' needs. 
Since the branches of foreign banks will not be accepting retail deposits , they will be subject to slightly less stringent regulatory requirements in Canada than the subsidiaries of foreign banks . 
That which has this power over human life , that is a false power , that is there only because we give it that power and we pretend that it has that power over us in some objective way rather than realising that it has that power over us because we give it that power . 
There has been activity in Switzerland and in the U.S. Banks are getting larger , partly to develop economies of scale in order to afford the types of technologies necessary to be competitive in the global environment . 
Are the competitive incentives there ? 
The Deputy Speaker : 
There should be rapid massive transit in this country , especially in areas like this , but of a more frequent nature . 
Mr. Paul Szabo ( Mississauga South , Lib . ) : 
Farmers are telling me that when they see the forms , they get extremely frustrated. 
The federal government acknowledges the important contribution the marine industry makes to our national economy . 
Mr. Lynn Myers 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton 
Mr. Charlie Power 
Mr. Randy White : 
It is so very serious that it has been turned down like this in this shady way . 
They all thought it was a big joke to destroy the private member ' s bill of the member for Mississauga East . 
The committee also heard that 60 % of all sex offenders admitted to federal prisons were multiple sex offenders who received concurrent sentences . 
The most startling and disturbing statistic was that the likelihood a person who has committed an offence of murder or rape will reoffend , compared to average law - abiding citizen , was 100 % more likely to commit a murder or a rape after being released on the conviction of such an offence . 
I can understand the parliamentary secretary ' s having a little difficulty with my French . 
I will get through them quickly . 
We have a technical glitch . 
That is our difficulty . 
The Speaker : 
RUN AGAINST RACISM 
Mr. Speaker , now that the air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have begun , a number of questions arise , particularly the question of Canadian participation in expanded military operations . 
Is he going to send him away for political indoctrination ? 
Ms. Caroline St - Hilaire ( Longueuil , BQ ) : 
Canada set the tone at the FAO . 
Hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
It is time we took the steps needed to ensure this kind of destruction will never happen again off the coast of Atlantic Canada or anywhere in the world . 
Maybe then the officer will be allowed to lay the charge . 
This morning the member for Sydney - Victoria commented about what he referred to as a diversion when we were talking about a private member ' s bill on consecutive sentencing . 
He asked me a question that I would love to answer , but under the rules I do not think I can . 
We made progress a couple of weeks ago at the FAO in Rome and Canada can continue to provide leadership in that regard . 
By trying to keep two pots on the boil , Canada might miss the boat . 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
That has led to significant improvements in the situation of welfare recipients and single parents . 
It allows for an individual situation to be interpreted on the basis of a whole range of social economic factors , unlike the word poverty which is deemed to be too narrow because it focuses exclusively on economic factors . 
Mr. Preston Manning 
Mr. Svend J . Robinson 
Mr. Daniel Turp 
It is not good bookkeeping and it is certainly not good economics . 
What it is really saying is that Reform , by not voting for the budget , does not support the national child benefit which was in the budget . 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy : 
Now , the Minister of Finance , our master magician , our sleight of hand specialist , is getting into the act and unveiling his own monument . 
There is nothing in the budget to tackle what are environmental concerns across the country , even the simple issue like a transit pass being available to employees in the same way as parking passes are . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
It is a growing problem which the federal government should look at and decide what measures it should take . 
There is no denying that the federal government has plenty of money at this time . 
Given that the Minister of Justice just the other week made comments indicating that social condition should at least be considered or studied to be added to the charter of human rights , would the member not think that by not supporting Bill S - 11 on this occasion and perhaps doing it down the road is an indication that the government prefers a bit of partisanship as opposed to doing the right thing and voting for Bill S - 11 right away ? 
We have opened our doors to them in the past and stand ready to do it again today . 
Mr. Speaker , in this Ann é e canadienne de la francophonie , Gis è le Lalonde and SOS Montfort are in court today to achieve recognition of the rights of Ontario francophones to their health institutions , and to the maintenance of the only francophone hospital west of the Ottawa River . 
Mr. Speaker , this is our third debate on the topic since October . 
At this time I want to debate what is going on today because the priority of the government is to make sure that we have a peaceful situation there and that we will not need to send combat troops there . 
The opposition can have it . 
That is not open to question . 
These are the emotions we all feel , not just in the House but across Canada and around the world . 
At this moment the official position is that it should be a NATO force because there is a feeling that there is no possibility of something else . 
Where does the government and parliament stand ? 
The direct answer to your question is no , there will not be a vote because it does not alter the original order which the House adopted today . 
Mrs. McLaughlin , who was then leader of the NDP , accepted the invitation . 
If we are to make the legacy of the Kosovo tragedy a lasting and positive legacy , if we are to make this the beginning of a time when governments take their responsibilities for human rights seriously , then we have a lot of work to do . 
Nor is this a precedent which should bind our hands in circumstances where the prospects of successful intervention might be stronger . 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member , but the question is too long . 
All hon. members are aware that Canada has now doubled its initial contribution of six CF - 18 s for a total of twelve . 
And we see their despair daily . 
As was asked by the member for Compton - Stanstead earlier in question period , has the Government of Canada made a commitment to NATO to send in ground troops ? 
I want to also assure him that there are no commitments . 
Canada is one player . 
These are leaders for whom power is the arbiter , not the law . 
Destroy our souls ? 
The treatment of Kosovar Albanians has consistently been terrible , but it pales in comparison to the depths of depravity that Mr. Milosevic has reached. 
We are putting up millions of dollars . 
I am not sure that the OSCE is the answer . 
We were basically taking a position and making a decision around an issue to which I am fundamentally opposed , the use of violence . 
Mr. Lynn Myers ( Waterloo - Wellington , Lib . ) : 
Does the solution pass through Russia and a constructive Russian intervention in the Kosovo issue ? 
If part III estimates for 1999 - 2000 are to be trusted we are going to be below 60,000 next year . 
I made references to the disasters we have had before to come to the point that we do not end up with another disaster of the type that we had in Dieppe or Hong Kong and so on . 
Are we there because we have a particular interest or are we there because we are the world policemen ? 
Maybe it has been baptised. 
Throughout the cold war the issues were admittedly much easier to understand . 
Mr. Charlie Power ( St. John ' s West , PC ) : 
Do we not have an obligation to ask ourselves whether we are living in a changed world , a world in which we have learned the lessons of failure to intervene in grave cases such was Rwanda or even the second world war ? 
But the interests we seek to preserve and protect in this region are significant . 
So , for the moment , some 800,000 Kosovars are still in their homes , that is , less than the original population of this country , which was some 1,800,000 . 
It seems that we planned for the military campaign as part of NATO , but we seem to have forgotten that when bombs start to fall one of the natural things that occurs is that the number of refugees tends to increase . 
Mr. Peter Adams ( Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Government in the House of Commons , Lib . ) : 
Madam Speaker , if the Progressive Conservative member is right when he says that 100,000 men have disappeared , it may be that this is no longer ethnic cleansing but genocide . 
It articulates a series of methods for identifying the precursors to conflict and pragmatic tools such as the use of diplomacy and economic levers that have not been explored to prevent conflict from occurring . 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
Hon. Charles Caccia 
The federal government increased spending on health care and increased transfers to the provinces for that but has not provided a comprehensive and coherent long term strategy for health care despite the fact that health care costs in Canada will continue to grow by about $ 3 billion per year due to changing demographics . 
We will no doubt hear from some , especially the NDP , the Bloc , and to some extent the Liberals , that if only big , bad corporations paid their full share average working people would be better off . 
In other words , if we had that money , if we had not overspent and if we did not have to pay interest we could eliminate the GST , something government members said they would do . 
We saw no original proposal in the budget for fighting the very negative effects of child poverty , among other things . 
Yet there is extreme urgency . 
We remain with some serious problems that could have been addressed by the government but were not . 
How can the government justify taking taxes from a low income family ? 
Madam Speaker , I am very happy to answer the hon. member ' s question . 
If the Bloc Quebecois were not here in Ottawa , who would represent Quebec ' s interests ? 
The Liberals claim they are giving Canadians $ 1.5 billion in tax relief this year , $ 2.8 billion next year and $ 3.4 billion by 2001 - 02 for a total of about $ 7.7 billion . 
Pierre Lebrun , the gunman , took his own life that day and leaves behind a grieving mother . 
Toronto Lodge 1600 has been in existence for 84 years but this occasion marked the first time that the lodge has owned its own building . 
Is Canada prepared to advance the proposition that if Milosevic will stop the atrocities , stop the killing and agree to come to the table , NATO will suspend the bombing ? 
The right hon. Prime Minister . 
What are the immediate and long term goals for the NATO air strikes ? 
I ask the Prime Minister , what part of the word vote does he not understand ? 
Only the Yugoslav President remained intransigent . 
We went to Bosnia and became a police force . 
We will limit the questions and the answers to one minute maximum . 
Unfortunately , close historical ties between Russia and Serbia and special political ties between Yugoslavia and China made it impossible . 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe : 
What precisely does she say we should have done ? 
Despite our huge investment in peacekeeping in the former Yugoslavia , Canada was not invited to be a member of the contact group negotiating with the various sides of the conflict in 1995 . 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain : 
In addition to our military contribution to NATO , the Canadian forces are taking an active part in addressing the humanitarian tragedy that has resulted from the gruesome actions of the Yugoslav government . 
The situation , I repeat , is in constant evolution . 
We must ensure that any decision to engage Canadian forces has been carefully thought through as a clear definition of Canada ' s role and has a well defined goal. 
The military could not do the job it was assigned to do because of the very political interference that we hope to avoid here . 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai ( Calgary East , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Daniel Turp ( Beauharnois - Salaberry , BQ ) : 
We know very well that the UN has proven totally incapable of staunching the hemorrhage that started in Kosovo long before NATO initiated its air strikes . 
Bosnian Serb forces overran Srebrenica and Zepa , safe areas , in July . 
I wonder if it could not be used in the present situation if we are unable to take further action compatibly with the charter . 
Continue , keep going , make them even stronger . 
When we talk about a people being purged and driven from their country and being slaughtered because someone is not content with the ethnic background of the particular group of people , that is not a cleansing process . 
Last September this house unanimously supported a resolution calling on the government of the federal republic of Yugoslavia and the parties involved in this inhumane confrontation to lay down their arms and to negotiate a solution with help from international organizations . 
They were calling for an end to the bombing , an end to the ethnic cleansing and a return to negotiations . 
Unfortunately , if the Kosovo conflict moves to the next phase , it is likely that we will see NATO ground troops . 
That is a question we asked today . 
This is another reason for fighting to end the attack on Yugoslavia '' . 
What the government has decided to do , and we have agreed with it , is to bomb and I believe possibly today the foreign affairs minister has agreed that if necessary we might put in ground troops . 
I have a list of over 30 countries that have recently experienced ethnic cleansing in one form or another . 
There should then be an opportunity for members to vote on whether or not to do that . 
We cannot do that . 
As a loyal and effective member of NATO , Canada is striving , along with its allies , to find a solution to this conflict and to promote a fair political settlement that will allow refugees to go back in their country in safety . 
In fact , the border closings , the mines laid at the borders , and the numerous atrocities against the Kosovars reveal the intentions of Milosevic and his security forces to commit genocide against the Kosovo people . 
But one thing is sure : it is still our brothers and sisters who are suffering . 
They have done things like cut down all the trees for firewood because they did not have any other means of fire . 
Kosovo is the latest of those countries , the one that is the apple of the eye of the media , the one that is drawing the most attention . 
They are engaging in bad economics . 
The first condition would have to be that NATO could very clearly show that a commitment of ground troops was necessary in order to halt the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and provide a safe home for Kosovars in the region . 
We cannot have it both ways . 
Many of my constituents have tremendous concerns . 
The final point I wish to make is with respect to our military quagmire . 
In the Boer War the British were in South Africa and they could not quell the Boer farmers . 
As well , in today ' s newspapers , we read that the British authorities estimate the number of men Kosovar refugees who may have disappeared at 100,000 . 
He explained his position but he may also have to help all those countries to have a better knowledge of the issue , a better knowledge of the situation . 
There are those who will argue that the use of force against Milosevic ' s efforts in Kosovo is not in line with multilateralism or with Canada ' s traditions . 
Knowing the Prime Minister and how he takes his job seriously , it must be difficult for him to be sitting at the top and making decisions such as this . 
Instead of using the incapacity of the UN as a reason for expanding its own role in the world , one of the things NATO could have been doing for a long time is playing a role at the UN in reforming the UN so that the UN itself could act . 
The concern was for no other reason than family . 
There were those in the ranks of his party who said what happened in Europe did not matter to Canada . 
As one Canadian , I have grave concerns about the way we seem to have gotten into a conflict without a long term view of the consequences . 
I heard one member speak earlier about the involvement of the IMF and the World Bank . 
It will take years , decades or longer , maybe well beyond our own lifetimes , for there to be real solutions . 
I must ask the simple question : 
It is clear that what Mr. Milosevic is undertaking in Serbia and Kosovo is wrong and that is the basis of this debate tonight . 
In 1993 , acting in another professional capacity , I had the opportunity to chat with Martin Gray at the launching of one of his books . 
People are dying . 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye : 
Twenty days ago all political parties in the House , including the NDP , supported that intervention because we believed that it was necessary to provide a humanitarian response to the atrocities that were taking place . 
Everybody will have trouble with it . 
In this case we will not bomb the Serbs into submission , but that may not be the deal anyway . 
After hearing reports on the public network , on CNN and from independent reporters , we have to admit that the Kosovars are very close to being the victims of a genocide . 
We take our freedoms so much for granted. 
Let us make sure the door we rightly opened to military interventions on humanitarian grounds cannot be abused in the future by aggressors claiming some minor trespass against political ethics , which would be exaggerated of course . 
It demanded that both sides end the hostilities , not just one side but both sides . 
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES 
Mr. Steve Mahoney 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy 
( Division 377 ) 
Mr. Speaker , the second petition is from farm families in the Kelvington Nut Mountain area of Saskatchewan . They are calling on the House not to accept major recommendations of the Estey report on grain transportation , including specifically the abolishment of the cap on freight rates , the altering of the role of the Canadian Wheat Board in managing transportation and handling of export grains . 
In that instance , it might be possible to provide cost estimates for the prosecution . 
Mr. Ted White : 
There is the capacity in the shipyards in Halifax . 
Having already heard from these people , I recognized some others , so I went to them . 
Hon. Ronald J . Duhamel : 
When it comes to the Constitution that currently governs Canada and contains the fundamental rules according to which people are living together , it is now shameful to talk about it . 
Nothing , absolutely zip . 
The members of the Reform Party have alienated eastern Canada , Atlantic Canada . 
Members have been kicked out of government for not voting with the government and now sit on their own as independents . 
First , they are insulted that a task force has to be sent to a province where there are 24 MPs who would be glad to tell the government and the Prime Minister of exactly the sorts of things that alienate the people of the province I live in and represent . 
They are collapsed and in decay because they had too damned much government . 
In that sense we are still growing and that is important to note . 
I would like the hon. member to comment on that . 
People in Saskatoon are not stupid. 
Madam Speaker , I want to ask the member opposite why his own party has been ignoring the growing western alienation that the Reform Party is facing by its grassroots supporters . 
Madam Speaker , the Secretary of State for economic development for the regions of Quebec criticized at the start of his speech the so called petty politics of the opposition parties . 
I predict that we will continue to see steady decreases in both unemployment and the political fortunes of both the Reform and Conservative parties . 
Mr. Jacques Saada ( Brossard - La Prairie , Lib . ) : 
Would the Prime Minister care to tell us when he and his Minister of Foreign Affairs lost their faith in parliamentary democracy ? 
That number is absolutely outrageous . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
On a related matter , whether we like it or not , the Kosovo Liberation Army is , and will continue to be , an increasingly important player in the conflict in Kosovo and in the possible solutions to that conflict . 
Mr. Speaker , prior to question period , on the debate on the alienation of all Canadians I was quoting what municipal leaders in Manitoba were saying about regional alienation and how their constituents perceived Ottawa . 
Other than a few of the big city mayors , they did not know a thing about the task force . 
The fisheries of the east coast is in a terrible mess and most of that problem is due to policies that destroy small fishing villages . 
The Minister of Justice recently introduced amendments to the Young Offenders Act that are being lauded across the country . 
You recognize the gain you have from an affiliation with the party . 
The member also should acknowledge that in any analysis like this he cannot ignore the reality of equalization payments in Canada , of which Quebec is the single largest recipient . 
They are hurting . 
My province of Manitoba will receive $ 425 million in increased health care funding . 
It is a partnership of people . 
I ask the member whether all this has to be done away with ? 
The House resumed from March 24 consideration of the motion . 
YEAS 
Mr. Norman Doyle : 
There are two basic questions which must be asked. 
It has been one that has consumed me in my parliamentary life since I was elected in 1993 . 
The Minister of Health said that we had to be patient , that the budget was coming , that funds would be available , because health was a priority for the Prime Minister . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
PETITIONS 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Rick Borotsik ( Brandon - Souris , PC ) : 
The proposal is not talking about a pause and then something happening . 
Mr. Speaker , the debate in February concerned the deployment of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo . 
In that period of time the problem has not been corrected. 
Recruitment activities are well under way . 
Mr. Speaker , I too ask for the unanimous consent of the House to move the following motion . 
They note that studies under way at the University of Quebec are showing adverse health effects , especially on children and seniors , and that car manufacturers oppose the use of MMT . 
Agreed. 
They all willingly signed it . 
Mae Katt , Ontario regional director for Health Canada , said there was no problem , that they would have 15 physicians from McMaster on that date . 
The association said that this is not about money . 
We have had balanced budgets or better , which is expected this year again , and the government is committed to balanced budgets in the years 1999 - 2000 and 2000 - 2001 . 
If we take a province like Alberta , for example - and it is the same in Ontario - the actual component of what the province has put into health care has increased in the same length of time as the government was cutting its funding for health care . 
The cuts that this government decided to make to the transfers to the provinces between 1994 and 2003 are of the order of $ 33 billion . 
A lot of that $ 11.5 billion that was announced as going back into health care , is going to pay off previous debt incurred over the last number of years since this government took office . 
Earlier this year the International Narcotics Control Board , which is responsible for the implementation of United Nations drug conventions , released its annual report for 1998 . In the report the board called for unbiased research into the possible medical benefits of marijuana . 
In India , medium quality marijuana is called bang and high quality marijuana is called ganga . 
I am quite cautious about going down the road of recreational use and in fact am vigorously opposed in that regard . 
Of course , I am glad to join all those who have worked together to urge the federal government to have the political courage and the leadership to recognize the medicinal value of marijuana by immediately implementing measures to legalize the use of marijuana for therapeutic purposes . 
As I pointed out in the House on March 2 , in order to be effective the recently announced $ 5 million revitalization program for the downtown east side must be directed toward programs and social supports that will benefit residents and improve safety . 
Bill C - 78 . 
Mr. Mark Muise 
Ms. Sophia Leung 
Mr. Speaker , I have the honour to present the 68 th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs regarding the membership of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs . 
Mr. Speaker , I am very pleased to have this opportunity to talk about this bill and about this subject . 
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Why not simply do what is right ? 
I firmly believe that if we were to lower the tax rate , the rate of compliance would increase to such a point that the government would suddenly discover it is getting more revenue than it did with the higher tax rate . 
Farmers have to go through all kinds of calculations and measurements , and it is not very easy to do . 
This type of paying up front by the government has to stop. 
We go there at our peril . 
Can I say that ? 
The projection for 1998 - 99 was for revenues of $ 144 billion . 
Last year alone we saw $ 74.1 million or 13 % of the RCMP ' s budget slashed. 
Ontario is not the only province that is a little upset and disappointed with this bill . 
Subsection 37 ( 2 ) states : 
The government has responded to that , yet it has not mandated that the courts must apply the tough measures . 
The devil made me do it is not a term that actually works in this particular case . 
Member spoke in Punjabi and provided the following translation : ] 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings ( Notre - Dame - de - Gr â ce - Lachine , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , as the Prime Minister just indicated , on the weekend there was a meeting of G - 8 senior officials in which a series of proposals were examined. 
We also have discussed this with the Secretary General of the United Nations , and the five basic principles he put forward are encompassed in this plan . 
Hon. Paul Martin ( Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I recognize the good intentions of members of the New Democratic Party . 
The parliamentary secretary should know that once the Nisga ' a treaty is ratified this denial of basic rights can never be corrected because the treaty expressly states that Nisga ' a laws will prevail over federal and provincial laws in the case of a conflict . 
He will be missed by all who knew him . 
The list includes murder , attempted murder , manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault . 
In 1997 , it dropped by 7 % , thus contributing to the drop in the overall crime rate and confirming a trend observed since 1991 . 
Mr. Speaker , as I have already indicated in my speech , the figures I used come from Statistics Canada . 
They come out with a statement saying that the Reform Party supports legislation which would allow the publication of the names of all convicted offenders , including young offenders . 
I do not know why he said these things . 
I will tell him about a couple of incidents . 
However , to dare number this bill as C - 68 is quite the strategy . 
After the member for Mississauga West has spoken and gets the member for Wild Rose all riled up , I happen to be the next person to speak . 
Mr. Speaker , extensive comment was made about the United Alternative . 
Criminals should know that the use of a firearm will automatically add 10 years to the sentence for the commission of one of these serious offences . 
I will repeat this . 
It is the result of a domestic dispute . 
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members ' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the order paper . 
Mr. Mike Scott

The UNFA also sets out general principles and obligations regarding the setting up , functioning and strengthening of regional fisheries organizations and provides rules concerning the participation of states in such organizations . 
Of the $ 100 million promised for licence buyback measures , only $ 23.4 million is accounted for .

Indeed , it has become an essential and vital component of international trade .

As further information is developed we will be providing it through the Minister of National Defence to the House .

In fact the Federation of Agriculture describes the application forms , not the booklet incidentally , as elaborate and charges that AIDA is all about saving money , not saving farmers . 
In accordance with its order of reference of Tuesday , October 20 , 1998 , your committee has considered Bill C - 235 , an act to amend the Competition Act ( protection of those who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who compete with them at retail ) and agreed on Thursday , April 15 , 1999 to report it with the following amendments : delete the clauses and the title of the bill . 
This is the spirit of the letter in the UN Fisheries Agreement . 
The objective is to get people to understand the spirit of the agreement , which they do not currently . 
During report stage debate the government said that it would implement a three day period in the UNFA through regulations at a future date . 
In the 1980 s when the cod stocks were being seriously depleted there was always the argument that we did not have enough scientific proof to significantly reduce quotas . 
Now we have another problem facing the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the Government of Canada square in the face every day . 
Sadly , the act often leads to the death or injury of either the individual committing it , the police officers who are trying to fulfill their duty to protect the public , or some innocent bystander who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
If a person causes injury , the penalty for imprisonment is for a term not exceeding 10 years . 
The death of Constable Sonnenberg was one of these tragedies . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te 
Mr. Rick Casson 
Mr. Jean - Guy Chr é tien 
We can see that happening . 
In particular , Canadian objectives in discussions on reforming the international architecture are presently focused on ensuring that the substantive aspects of these discussions take place within a permanent process that is representative of the major participants in the international financial system , that measures to effectively involve the private sector in crisis resolution are established to attenuate imprudent lending , and that the social aspects of international financial crises are addressed. 
It has a significant element within its Congress that regularly attacks the United Nations . 
The same member , who is now Prime Minister , should be consistent since he is the one who said on January 15 , 1991 , and I quote : 
Madam Speaker , I will begin by restating why Canada is involved in the action with NATO in the former Yugoslavia . 
Because this issue is so important to our democracy is why I can strongly endorse this motion before us today . 
We should know what is involved. 
Nobody had died because of the allied forces . 
You cannot vote conditionally . 
We had evidence of that on several occasions .

Mr. Speaker , I am delighted to report that the Prix Hommage b é n é volat - Qu é bec was awarded to the Soci é t é de l ' autisme et des troubles envahissants du d é v é loppement , T . E . D . , de Laval as part of the National Volunteer Week . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Let us talk about what we have done . 
Mr. Speaker , the minister has talked about the essentials . 
We want to enable them to play an even greater role in Canadian life . 
The House heard the terms of the motion moved by the hon. member for Brampton Centre . 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton ( Minister of National Defence , Lib . ) : 
But if Mr. Milosevic is not stopped , the people of the region will continue to be punished by him . 
This is not even taking into account the rapes , the physical atrocities and the psychological sufferings of an entire people . 
By its mean attitude , the government is jeopardizing the strong consensus that had spontaneously formed around him on the issue of the military intervention in the former Yugoslavia . 
According to the Minister of National Defence , over 131 parliamentarians have spoken on the subject . 
Mr. Speaker , I listened carefully to my colleague ' s speech . 
We could talk about the banning of kiddie porn . 
We are with you as you stand to represent the values that Canadians hold dear about truth and peace and trying to do the right thing in a very difficult situation '' . 
A diplomatic solution to the Kosovo conflict has always been the course preferred by Canada and its allies . 
The British Prime Minister goes once every two weeks . 
I answered that votes have been taken in Germany , and that two votes have been taken in the Czech Republic to determine whether the country ought to get involved in such a conflict . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Those representations were made by the Prime Minister personally to the new chancellor of Germany . 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 211 
TAXATION 
Mr. Grant McNally 
The petitioners state that there have been no housing starts by either federal or provincial governments in Nunavik in the past three years . 
Victims of crime are finally going to see a start of some significant initiatives toward rights and privileges . 
The minister has used the excuse that the justice committee is presently reviewing the Corrections and Conditional Release Act so the government will await that report before deciding whether to initiate reforms to that legislation in regard to victims ' rights . 
As an example , the Government of Quebec has implemented a system of co - operation between the CSST , the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance in order to provide financial support to victims through the application of its crime victims compensation act . 
From my own years in the courts it is clear that the judiciary in many cases looked in the past to the crown to represent the views of the victim to some extent , especially at sentencing hearings . 
Initiatives were taken in the previous parliament by members of the Reform Party as has been mentioned. 
Last month the Minister of Justice tabled the youth criminal justice act which also recognized in its principles the important role of victims in the youth justice system and their need for information . 
We brought the issue to the House of Commons many times during 1995 and 1996 . 
Madam Speaker , I will not belittle the issue of drugs by commenting on the remark of the member . 
It is a very important matter in their ridings , my riding and every riding across the country . 
There was the trauma of not knowing what the justice system would do for them . 
Does the member ' s party agree that in order to deal with the issue of reducing the harm of obtaining drugs illegally on the street that we have to provide a social and medical response ? 
If a victim has survived and wants to put it behind them , the last thing they want is for the whole world to know what they suffered and to have to relive it over and over . 
This is welcome , but we all know what the ultimate position should be in the area of this scandalous and pathetic section 745 . 
There is too much control of what goes on in this place . 
Mr. Speaker , April 1 marked the 10 th anniversary of Mississauga ' s Meadowvale Theatre . 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast . 
An hon. member : 
I would like the minister of taxes to stand in this House and tell these 150 companies why he thinks high taxes are helping their bottom lines . 
Band members are frightened and they are worried sick . 
Will the minister tell us today that he will open the competition for all federal government jobs to all Canadians who wish to apply ? 
There is going to have to be some serious intervention on the part of the Speaker , or on the part of a committee , where there is some sanction that is handed down and a message that is given and received before this type of behaviour is going to be stopped. 
Some of those people had been victims of various different crimes . 
Yet this is the person to whom the judge , in his infinite wisdom , turned Mr. Gervais over to , saying " Okay , instead of sending you to jail , we will send you home with certain conditions . 
Agreed. 
Dad and I went . 
I reiterate there are some who progress despite all efforts into more and more serious crime . 
I saw treated them in jail . 
The member talked about parole eligibility . 
The victims were attacked in their home , allegedly by 20 year olds and one 14 year old who have been arrested and charged. 
That is what she wants . 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party members present this evening , because it is such an excellent amendment , will be supporting the amendment . 
Agreed. 
We are depositing hundreds of millions of lead sinkers and jigs in our Canadian waterways every year . 
I was somewhat disappointed that he was willing to let the government bureaucracy run its course without a much greater fight . 
Environment Canada has also actively supported independent collection programs for lead sinkers and jigs that have been instituted by several organizations in Ontario , including the Ontario Ministry of the Environment , the Bay of Quinte Remedial Action Plan and the Hamilton Regional Conservation Authority .

If they do not have confidence in the way the government is handling this issue , they can go against what we are doing and tell our soldiers that they are not backed by the Reform Party . 
The official opposition support for our troops and against Milosevic is absolutely unwavering . 
Hon. Anne McLellan ( Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada , Lib . ) : 
Hon. Marcel Mass é ( President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure , Lib . ) : 
Again , I apologize most sincerely for this error in judgment and basic courtesy . 
No one will argue that the banking industry is a powerful decision maker in the financial sector and in the economy . 
Mr. Peter Adams : 
Some hon. members : 
We are still uncertain . 
I would like to return briefly to the verification system itself . 
In December 1995 , more than four years ago , I undertook a preliminary review of the youth justice system . 
I disagree with the crime rate of juvenile offenders in Quebec . 
There is a whole attempt on the intellectual and political front to misrepresent facts ; and this is dishonest . 
Canada could follow the lead of the British in that regard . 
Tactical studies often did not reflect the way officials said they actually planned to employ equipment , were done too late to influence decisions , produced results that contradicted the purchase decision , were undertaken by contractors who had an interest in the Department ' s decision , or were not done at all . 
Why did the member for Joliette ask me to replace him ? 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Pursuant to Standing Order 108 ( 2 ) , your committee proceeded to consider the state of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in Canada . 
It has urged NATO to consider a temporary halt in the bombing , urgent consultation with like - minded states , moving ahead within the United Nations . 
It may be so , but I would not underestimate the power of the Prime Minister to bring all his members into line even if some of them were against it . 
Bill C - 78 also includes a series of technical changes to improve the benefits linked to federal employee pension plans . 
They are to bring with them any outside related knowledge , skill or education that they have and employ that in the best interest of the board in the application of their duties . 
The government should listen to this message . 
The surplus will serve as well to cover unavoidable losses from investments in the stock market . 
It has been rolled in there to make it very difficult . 
The government would not allow any input from employees in terms of ethical investment funds or control of the types of investments that the new public sector investment board would make . 
In the long term that means a 3 % to 4 % reduction in pension benefits for Canadians . 
The underlying thrust of all of these proposed amendments is to ensure the long term sustainability of the Canadian public service pension plans . 
However , in 100 short years we have learned the hard lesson that these resources are also finite .

PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
That is my first point. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde : 
I believe this is empowering the unions to have a say in how they would like their pensions upgraded or altered as part of the bargaining unit . 
They have borne the cost of our health cuts and the sexual abuse in our military . 
Finally , the solicitor general will be given increased powers under the new bill for the financing and funding of the RCMP superannuation plan . 
It is increasing employee contributions and extending survivor benefits using inappropriate and undefined terms and then placing all this mess on the back of the Canadian taxpayer to bankroll . 
Mr. Chadderton supports recognizing veterans and members of the military , but the bill has much more in mind . 
Mr. Bob Wood ( Nipissing , Lib . ) :

At the moment the reports as to what the Russians understand the proposal to be and what the Serbians understand it to be are contradictory . 
That said , the bill before us at this time contains all the flexibility necessary to both pay tribute to what Quebec is doing and ensure that the public is better protected everywhere in this country . 
Does the government have no shame ? 
I would like to advise him that the lawyers on the case yesterday before the supreme court said " the tapes could potentially crop up again '' . 
Future contracts will be conducted in a competitive manner if industry shows sufficient interest in the process by which this is carried out .

PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
What a waste of time when in fact the people who really understand and know the issues are not listened to . 
I must thank and congratulate the auditor general. 
He said that it had to be a bankable program . 
I would like to thank the hon. member for Palliser , once again , for putting forward what I thought was a very interesting twist on this issue . 
The other 50 % comes from the government . 
In dealing with a problem , a dispute in a large firm , for example , because there are surpluses in the workers ' pension fund , we will no longer have any valid arguments . 
Also , taking into account that CPP premiums have been going up and the percentage of employee contributions was maximized at 7.5 % , which became less of a percentage overall , that meant that the government had to continue putting more money in to satisfy the needs of the pension plan on a current year basis . 
If the government takes the $ 30 billion , massages the books and then tells us what a wonderful job it is doing , a few years from now it will turn around and tell the taxpayers " We are sorry folks , there is a deficit in the plan . 
Now the Reform leader has started publicly comparing himself and his caucus to the Fathers of Confederation no less . 
In the memory of those tragic victims , we are each personally called to overcome this type of evil by upholding what is good in our family and in our community . 
Ms. Alexa McDonough ( Halifax , NDP ) : 
When the plan was indexed , that plan acquired a liability of $ 8 billion and more at one go . 
Their leaders today said that they do not believe in the government ' s safety assurances when it comes to its plan to transport plutonium . 
Mr. Pat Martin ( Winnipeg Centre , NDP ) : 
The deduction includes amounts expended for the rental , maintenance and insurance of the tools , the total cost of tools worth $ 250 or less subject to some adjustments as may be allowed in the regulations to take into consideration inflation , and for tools over $ 250 the amortization of the capital cost as set out in the regulations . 
" No more than three cameras will be permitted in a committee room at one time '' .

Some commercial harvesting licences have been removed from the fishery . 
Mr. Speaker , I want the member for St. Albert to clarify something . 
I will read from Hansard the NDP ' s view . 
Madam Speaker , I appreciated the speech to some degree , although I have a number of questions for the hon. member for Mississauga West . 
In addition , these federal public servants had not had a pay increase for six years . 
There is no bank account with $ 30 billion in it . 
It raids that $ 26 billion fund . 
It reminds one of the old Irish proverb which I have used before : 
In 1998 the Canadian Paediatric Society announced its unanimous endorsement with the World Health Organization ' s new recommended guidelines that mothers should breast feed for at least one year for optimal health outcomes of their children . 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom 
Hon. Marcel Mass é 
The member for Scarborough Southwest and I received these petitions this morning . 
Early in the conflict the New Democratic Party began urging that Canada persuade NATO to commit to a position that it would stop the bombing immediately if Milosevic would stop the atrocities and come to the table . 
I am receiving lots of letter in that regard . 
The second aspect of the motion today concerns the role of Russia . 
The Bloc Quebecois has always maintained that a diplomatic solution is to be favoured. 
Canada is an aggressor in Kosovo . 
I have an example . 
People are being exterminated. 
Madam Speaker , I will be sharing my time with a colleague . 
Today we intend to inform NATO that the government agrees to this request . 
We have heard talk about a blockade or an embargo . 
They are not there and they will not be there . 
We are already striking Yugoslavia with our NATO air forces to reduce the ability of the Yugoslavian military and paramilitary to commit aggression . 
This crisis represents a fundamental challenge to the values of democracy , human rights and the rule of law . 
They also receive specific training relevant to the mission and relevant to peacekeeping . 
Will we open up new fronts ? 
Mr. Nick Discepola ( Vaudreuil - Soulanges , Lib . ) : 
Discrimination and injustice in Canadian sports organizations funded by taxpayers - enough is enough . 
Mr. Speaker , according to the information we have , no petroleum products have been exported from Canada since January 1998 . 
Let me quote from the NATO communiqu é of this weekend to which his government agreed : " There can be no compromise on these conditions '' , referring to the five NATO conditions . 
The minister knows that civil court is the only place where victims can seek redress for pain and suffering . 
They have all the information . 
This has nothing to do with the fact that the minister may have referred to something else . 
And the European commissioner for humanitarian aid , Emma Bonino , agrees . 
Dear Colleagues , 
We must resettle the Kosovars to their original homeland . 
We introduced this motion today because we are now caught in a strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . 
We have to think now in terms of how we are going to find a way to bring the Serbian community , the Serbs and the Kosovars back together . 
Mr. Speaker , the UN should be involved. 
Therefore , I am sure that all NATO countries would welcome a reasonable solution that would end the fighting and restore the refugees to their homes and to their homeland . 
Moving back to some of the correspondence I have received , I received an e - mail addressed to the Prime Minister from Nenad Gajic , who I believe is a person from the Yugoslav area , expressing a strong protest toward NATO ' s and consequently Canada ' s declaration of war on the federal republic of Yugoslavia . 
Mr. Speaker , while I respect the member opposite and many of the things he said I just have to bring him up on one point. 
It cancelled the deal. 
The government has cut $ 23 billion in health care and education since it came to power . 
For the first time , despite Krever , this government is actually raising the possibility of indemnification from the responsibility of ensuring the safety of Canadians on all of those issues and matters regulated under the Food and Drugs Act . 
My suggestion to the hon. parliamentary secretary who will answer this question is that instead of the international trade minister looking after his future occupation , whatever that will be , he should start concentrating on Canadian jobs and Canadian exports in order to protect those jobs , especially in interior and coastal B.C.

The Deputy Speaker : 
Mr. Speaker , I am pleased to address the House and the issues raised by the member for Kelowna concerning mortgage insurance in Bill C - 66 . 
The CMHC enabled thousands of Canadians to live in decent , safe , affordable housing by building housing or providing mortgage insurance . 
I wanted to take this opportunity in my speech to remind the minister that , even if he is hiding behind statistical arguments - a lot of things can be proven with statistics - but in truth , he can cause hardship and move the CMHC away from its prime objective , which is to provide access to property , but not just any property , decent property . 
Ms. Libby Davies ( Vancouver East , NDP ) moved :

Apparently some people I consulted with may not have transmitted the message . 
The conclusions we came to were unanimous . 
They are not televised. 
All too often what is deemed to be a comprehensive report turns out to be totally ignored or , as has been so eloquently expressed here , it is tossed in the dustbin . 
What happened to that promise ? 
What in God ' s name are we doing here if we cannot help those who cannot help themselves ? 
Some hon. members : 
And more than five members having risen : 
We should recall the slogan of the Liberal government in 1968 , which called for a just society .

The area of Placentia and Argentia for example is in my federal riding of St. John ' s West . 
It will be the one jumping through the political hoops trying to please the various stakeholders involved in the project , many of whom have very legitimate concerns that must be addressed.

Of course the Bluenose is that famous vessel that was built in Nova Scotia during the 19 th century that won all the races and yet was a fishing vessel at the same time .

The Government of Canada fully supports efforts by the OECD to move closer to an internationally accepted set of rules that will eliminate unfair financing practices . 
I am sure motions often get put forward at Conservative Party conventions .

This year , if the tax dollars continue to come in at the same rate , the Minister of Finance will have over $ 20 billion in the surplus at the very least . 
It is time to reverse that trend and use that surplus to start to ease the burden of long suffering Canadian taxpayers . 
In all likelihood that report will collect dust because the recommendations are so good that the government is afraid to implement them . 
They had a chance to clean up government . They had what we call a golden opportunity . 
The Prime Minister broke his word in the weeks before the budget , since the letter on health care asked the government to totally reverse , within a reasonable timeframe and through existing arrangements under the Canada social transfer for health and social programs , the cuts it had made in its transfers in recent years . 
It is out of their control . 
Yesterday we heard the Prime Minister say there is no bracket creep . 
It goes without saying that the Bloc Quebecois and all the democrats in this House respect that principle , but this is not what is at issue when we are dealing with transfers to the provinces . 
When I look at the public accounts , I cannot help but wonder why we spend thousands of dollars for a committee to figure out what kind of recipes we can use blueberries in . 
The federal government has unilaterally decided to change the rules of the game and now Quebec will only get 8.3 % of the extra $ 11 billion in transfers over five years . 
There could be a small adjustment for a sparse population . 
There is no denying that , if Quebec were to opt out of the CHST and keep the whole GST , it would be safe from further erosion of the CHST by the federal government because it would control its own GST. 
The Flight of Passenger Pigeons , thanks to a $ 13,614 grant from the millennium bureau , involves only birds made of papier m â ch é .

Mr. Speaker , let me say how proud I was today on behalf of the Government of Canada to sign the final agreement . 
Mike Harris promises tax cuts . 
Mr. Speaker , to my mind the Nisga ' a treaty gives us the opportunity to yet again show how this side of the House , how the Liberal government , wants to make progress for the benefit of first nations in Canada . 
We are investing $ 100 million over five years in enforcing that statute and in efforts to discourage young people from starting to smoke . 
There will be $ 225 million for the new research institutes over the next three years ; $ 50 million in addition for the national health , research and development fund ; $ 35 million to the Canadian health services research foundation ; and $ 25 million - 
The government will raise the income threshold at which the child tax benefit begins to be phased out to $ 29,590 from a front level of $ 25,921 . 
I got sick in the spring of 1997 and ended up in the hallway of a hospital waiting for care . 
The Acting Speaker ( Ms. Thibeault ) : 
They know their neighbours and there is stability in the neighbourhood . 
I wish the minister , who is sensitive to the plight of prospective home owners , had taken this opportunity to bring penalties back to a more reasonable level . 
In addition , the CMHC is given the power to impose financial penalties when this or other conditions are not met . 
I also find it interesting that the hon. member who spoke previously talked about accountability to citizens and then went forward to object to the board of directors having a reduced number of bureaucrats and more individuals from every walk of life in Canada . 
Single parents are using 50 % or more of their income to pay their rent . 
I had an opportunity to question the minister responsible for CMHC on this bill . 
I do not want to list all these results but let me list a few examples . 
That , in the opinion of this House , the Parliament and Crown Agencies should be subject to scrutiny under the Access to Information Act . 
Obviously it is public money that is paying the salaries of individual members of parliament and I would suggest there is already a great deal of public scrutiny toward members of parliament . 
We are still waiting .

Mr. Greg Thompson ( New Brunswick Southwest , PC ) : 
The following offences are not presumed serious enough to warrant adult sentences : armed robbery , sexual assault and drug trafficking . 
Nowhere in the bill do we find confirmation of the right of the provinces to apply their own model . 
This approach included early detection and intervention as an effective means of crime prevention ; community based resolutions and sentences for non - violent offenders ; and lowering the minimum age to 10 , with the maximum age of 15 , plus publishing the names of all violent offenders . 
Somehow I doubt whether that will wash .

Along with strengthening health care , increasing the Canada child tax benefit and assisting below and modest income Canadians , Bill C - 71 also covers a range of other measures such as debt management , income tax administration , first nations taxation and public service pensions , among other things . 
There has been some progress made in that way over the last many years . 
It does not deal with things like regulation . 
If it did , perhaps Quebec would not have 30 % of all the welfare recipients in Canada . 
If federal transfer payments were to return to former levels , the number of people living on welfare would probably drop as well . 
There are no longer any reliable figures in the minister ' s budget . 
Again , did this budget do anything to assist those individuals in any real way ? 
What better leadership could be provided by the Minister of Finance and the government than eliminating tuition fees for everyone across Canada who wants to improve his or her education ? 
There is now in Canada and the United States a vicious cycle involving the poor . 
I could not agree more . 
Is it usual for a government to withdraw all the benefits from free trade , $ 22 billion from the GST and tens of billions of dollars from the surplus in the employment insurance fund , while overtaxing by some $ 30 billion at a time when people have no more money in their pockets . 
This is what is happening . 
It is a good question . 
So , they will be involved in a process of lifelong learning . 
The public is not being fooled. 
His brother Kelly was killed in action . 
As the magazine Qu é bec Entreprise points out in its most recent edition , the various economic stakeholders of one RCM in my riding have taken this very much to heart. 
This is a rational enough explanation . 
Mr. Speaker , on the subject of the millennium scholarships , two months ago I put a question to the Minister of Human Resources Development . 
He is saying that it is because the president was not there . 
Hon. Pierre S . Pettigrew ( Minister of Human Resources Development , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the French speaking people who are deaf and hard of hearing in Quebec and Canada do not have access to as many captioned programs as their English speaking counterparts. 
Farmers know that NISA is just not designed for the type of crisis we experienced. 
In fact , they announced , nobody dreamt it , an additional $ 11.5 billion in health transfers to the provinces over five years , including $ 2 billion in 1999 - 00 and $ 9 billion between now and 2004 . 
We know there is nothing less than that in the account . 
In the old days there were feudal lords and robber barons but democracy changed that . 
We get calls every day , as I am sure the member does , from people who are waiting for health care . 
I think we saw some of this abuse with regard to hotels in Montreal having a strong connection to the government and to the Prime Minister himself . 
No one likes taxes , but the GST was a replacement tax for a hidden federal manufacturing tax . 
I remember the former prime minister used to say that in 20 years we would not recognize this country . 
Some hon. members : 
It is strong . 
Those who contravene the act will face heavy fines and penalties . 
Under the terms of the convention Canada made a commitment to protect threatened species and habitats . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad 
Hon. Christine Stewart 
I would like to begin by congratulating members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations for their hard work on this bill . 
This does not mean that suddenly the marketplace is free to do as it pleases and that consumers are at risk . 
We understand CMHC , and builders , have a role to play in better promoting Quebec and Canadian housing know - how . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise today to congratulate three students of the University of Waterloo who last month won the prestigious ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest in the Netherlands . 
We are still wading through a pre - referendum campaign . 
Mr. Tony Valeri ( Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance , Lib . ) : 
As Charlie Brown would say , good grief , Mr. Speaker . 
* * * 
Can the parliamentary secretary to the minister of HRD inform the House what outcomes we can expect from the Saskatoon meetings ? 
Mr. Gerald Keddy ( South Shore , PC ) : 
I am fed up with this government . 
The Reform Party even brought in amendments to try and get the bill to go further . 
If something happened and I could not pay for the house , the government would guarantee CMHC 100 % of the mortgage insurance . 
I have a copy right here of the record of the last Progressive Conservative government from 1984 to 1993 . It lists the number of units built and the amount of money that was put into the social housing of this country . 
I believe that a further review of the CMHC is needed for the new millennium , but consultations should take place at the community level , not at the federal level . 
In that parliament the member for Sarnia - Lambton introduced Bill C - 216 , which would have amended the Broadcasting Act . 
A piece of legislation that bans abusive negative option marketing is a positive step in the promotion of consumers ' right to choice '' . 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. Myron Thompson 
Mr. Lee Morrison 
I am sure members will recall that in the 1998 budget the government made some improvements to what is known as the registered education savings plan . 
Members have risen in this House and read out passages from this bill , or have referred to this and other bills as being as thick as phone books . 
In this case too , the government has not gone far enough in supporting students in Quebec and Canada . 
The Minister of Human Resources Development is a kind of sherpa for the Minister of Finance . 
The government had laid off 55,000 people and inflation and interest rates had gone down but now the problem was the deficit. 
They practise the grey area of taxation . 
It is going to take a significant , mature and holistic approach to what are systemic problems . 
At that meeting over and over again tax experts suggested that the baby step movement in Canada with the GST to a consumption base was very important for Canadian competitiveness . 
The government wants to close the debate and get on with the vote , and I suppose in a way I do not blame it , since we have already filed our income taxes which concern this bill . 
When I was a youngster we had scavenger hunts and they did not cost a penny . 
Thanks to all the nurses in Canada and congratulations to them for them invaluable contribution . 
POVERTY 
That is exactly what we need to get to . 
Mr. Monte Solberg ( Medicine Hat , Ref. ) : 
We all share in the responsibility to find every missing child .

INTERPARLIAMENTARY DELEGATIONS 
The Speaker : 
What will the government do with the surplus ? 
They stopped within 55 cents per $ 100 of what the EI commissioner said was sufficient to maintain the EI fund as well as to provide for a rainy day fund in case there was a dramatic decrease in the economy and more people were claiming benefits . 
Mr. Speaker , I was very interested in my colleague ' s speech . 
It should not artificially reduce the deficit. 
They could not stand the Canadian tax regime . 
He was refused that surgery outright for at least three months . 
While I realize this initiative may not be a panacea , it may be at least one of the components in reducing youth crime and developing a more emotionally and socially adjusted adolescent into our society . 
I heard a colleague from the Bloc address this . 
Drop it down a bit further so that we can at least start the process of rehabilitation , bringing that person into a system , be it the criminal justice system or be it a diversion into the social welfare net . 
Our number one goal is to make sure that they never come back into the justice system again . 
Maybe in his lifetime we will see real change in the country , in the words of the minister , " in a timely fashion '' . 
So it had to be changed. 
Mr. Bob Kilger : 
ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS 
Report stage 
Hon. David M. Collenette 
Division on Motion No. 9 deferred 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting . 
By Thursday morning , the bill was in committee for clause by clause . 
I would propose the most striking example from my riding , that of the pillage of the fund of the former employees of the Singer company . 
For instance , the government should not invest in any company that might be engaged in a service that is contracted out which would cost public service members their jobs . 
It proposes tragically to completely remove any kind of public scrutiny of the management of these public service pension plans . 
Unfortunately , this is a most unfair way as well . 
That is wrong . 
They continually want to talk about the so - called issue of closure which is not what we are doing at all . 
The government in its usual way is assuring Canadians and pensioners that this is a much better method of safeguarding their money because , after all , if we cannot trust our government who can we trust . 
We would think that the tax grab would stop. 
Order , please . 
They must not be changed to the detriment of seniors . 
Unfortunately the government is not giving them the power , the resources and the tools to do their job . 
It is not a point of this debate . 
The government will not allocate the funds to train people . 
I think he did not anticipate the authority of the Minister of Finance , who saw things quite differently than he did. 
* * * 
Mr. Speaker , in June Mr. Justice Cory will be retiring from the Supreme Court of Canada after 10 years of distinguished service . 
Furthermore , as the parliamentary secretary said , as and when the refugees apply to stay here permanently this is a matter which will be given further consideration . 
It is not down . 
North America is part of one of the strongest economies in the world . 
YOUTH 
Mr. Peter Mancini ( Sydney - Victoria , NDP ) : 
No. 
The advisory board can make recommendations of names , but the minister does not necessarily have to accept those names . 
We are not dealing here with pilferage , or shoplifting . 
Yea . 
( f ) by replacing line 42 on page 43 with the following : 
" survivor or began to reside with the survivor in a relationship described in subsection 25 ( 4 ) after " 
As a lawyer I know that lawyers do not use language indiscriminately . 
I salute the Government of Quebec for having had the courage to do this . 
He or she may also have worked in the same job over a period of 10 years . 
I would be supportive after hearing especially from the equality seeking groups across the land who are coming to the table and discussing this as the consultations go forward . 
However , the hon. member has every right to condemn what appears prima facie to be unjust , that is allowing a guilty person to benefit from a reduced sentence . 
The defence of provocation came into being at a time when a life came second to an insult of honour . 
How can he not want to see change so that kind of incident will never happen again ? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough 
Hon. David Anderson 
Motion No. 87 
CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME DAY 
There are so many ways , Jay , 
The Prime Minister has a million and one excuses for why he needs these high taxes but he keeps getting mixed up with the facts . 
Mr. Speaker , I would just like to state again that this is not a government paper , it is just a working paper . 
We have already forwarded the money promised. 
CANADIAN MILITIA 
It is a fair severance package with early retirement . 
The petitioners submit that these measures are not geared to the needs of fisheries workers , and that over 800 residents of the Magdalen Islands will be affected by the moratorium . 
" knowledges the need to " 
That Bill C - 32 , in Clause 79 , be amended by replacing lines 18 and 19 on page 51 with the following : 
Industry requires goal posts . 
The definition in the bill is clear and credible . 
We tried to control pollution in our air , our water and our soil . 
We supported this inclusion of the principle at committee stage and we support this motion which defines what the precautionary principle means for the purposes of this section . 
Motion No. 2 would eliminate the words " to phase out the generation and use of the most persistent '' . 
After a large amount of diligent work by all members of the committee , I felt that Bill C - 32 , as amended in committee , although nowhere as strong as I would have wanted it to be , was a step forward and I fully intended to support it . 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan ( York North , Lib . ) : 
It should also be prepared to invoke the notwithstanding clause of the charter of rights and freedoms if necessary . 
There were beneficial results when it was used with a moderate level of child distress . 
When we talk about this section of the Criminal Code , we want to be careful not to dismiss the issue of child abuse because that is something that is not sanctioned by section 43 of the Criminal Code . 
In other words , if a child had a severe behavioural problem , and discipline or punishment was not having any positive results , it did little good to later blame bad behaviour on the physical punishment when in many cases the bad behaviour was there to begin with . 
NUNAVUT 
Hon. Arthur C . Eggleton 
( Division 428 ) 
My constituents and I have now been waiting 169 days . 
In this particular bill we have motions brought forward in part of the MP pension plan and other plans that say that the government will just simply take the money back . 
The Liberals say that they are defending the family , except when they will not fight court cases that undermine it . 
One day he woke up and found he had bet the wrong way and had broken the bank . 
It used to have to be tabled here and be debated here . 
It has been a feature of the public service pension plans for many years . 
I think the point my colleague is trying to make today about democracy taking a back seat is a very important one . 
Let us now take a look at what Bill C - 78 does . 
Our military men and women throughout the world work hard on behalf of Canada . 
We want to delete the clauses which allow the government to make off with the surplus in the first place . 
Some hon. members : 
The Citizen article went on to say that Ms. Campbell is worried that the government ' s actions may allow other employers to lobby for changes that will allow them to get at pension surpluses when they need some cash . 
I have presented hundreds , not dozens but hundreds of petitions to the House which this bill completely ignores . 
That is hogwash . 
She said three times that she anticipates the report , that she awaits the report . 
I am really disappointed by what is going on right now . 
Mr. Chuck Strahl ( Fraser Valley , Ref. ) : 
The charter applies to the federal and provincial governments . 
That is part of the package and it has to be looked at as a total package . 
The first fiscal plan will continue to include a contingency reserve as a buffer against unexpected financial pressures . 
Mr. Derrek Konrad ( Prince Albert , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Steve Mahoney ( Mississauga West , Lib . ) : 
Indirectly he has divested himself of these interests , temporarily , while he is a cabinet minister . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
I can clear this up very quickly . 
It is part of the pay package and wage package . 
We will show them a thing or two '' . 
Over and over the member for Glengarry - Prescott - Russell would say things like that whenever debate was restricted in the House . 
And more than five members having risen :

Mr. Speaker , I believe you would find consent to apply the results of the vote just taken to Motion No. 3 . 
Mr. Speaker , I rise on a point of order . 
Currently a wilful failure by the responsible adult to comply with the undertaking is a summary conviction offence . 
What is even worse is that young people will pay the price . 
Mr. George Proud 
Mr. Rick Laliberte 
The vast majority of pardon recipients are law abiding at the time of being pardoned. 
I commend my colleague from Brossard - La Prairie . 
This will be an issue for another day , but I suggest again that when it comes to the protection of children , information is power . 
This is why our government is proud to have increased the museums assistance program ' s budget by $ 2 million this year and to sponsor Bill C - 64 , which will institute the indemnification program for travelling exhibitions . 
Mr. Speaker , the CSN congress begins today and will choose a successor to the man who profoundly marked Quebec , G é rald Larose . 
Mr. Speaker , the trade minister originally opposed the head tax as not Liberal. 
We had a tax cut of $ 16.5 billion over three years . 
In my home province there is a suicide watch on farmers . 
If working people have no right to the $ 30 billion surplus in their own pension , why does the pensions benefit act require a two - thirds majority vote by all plan members on the use of any surplus in any other pension plan in the federal sector ? 
Is that agreed ? 
Furthermore , conflicts of jurisdiction could arise which would further aggravate the settlement of liability claims . 
Maybe he will come back in again after he has a bowl of soup or something . 
In the Swissair disaster , the victims ' families were protected under the American passengers bill of rights .

EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Mr. Rick Casson 
We and other countries must focus more on preventing the consumption within our own countries of illegal substances such as pot , heroin , cocaine , Ritalin , T ' s and R ' s and a kaleidoscope of illegal drugs used by many people . 
The Ontario court has already found part of the Narcotics Act to be unconstitutional , particularly where the use of marijuana for health purposes is concerned. 
I congratulate the member for Rosemont for taking this initiative and we look forward to further debate on the issue before the House . 
I talked with the department involved and it said they opted out of the pension plan . 
Mr. Eric Lowther ( Calgary Centre , Ref. ) : 
We regularly experience it in the committees as well . 
All this is very hard to accept . 
Many people believe that the issue has been settled , that the Singer employees won a victory and that $ 1.7 billion was shared between survivors . 
That is one point I wanted to make . 
We have registered time and time again our concern with that arbitrary move on the part of the government and with its failure to reach some sort of agreement with all the different organizations involved. 
The new strategy will also help address a broad range of human resource needs related to aboriginal youth , persons with disabilities , child care and several other social and economic challenges . 
We would have liked to have seen the federal government not making a spectacle of itself in the eyes of the Mexicans by refusing to organize a meeting between the Mexican President and Mr. Bouchard . 
Hon. John Manley ( Minister of Industry , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , we are following a proper lawful process with respect to this expropriation . 
In the meantime it is appropriate that the complaint be referred to the police for investigation . 
The strategy also includes a $ 30 million component over a five year period . 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
Mr. Speaker , I suggest that the remaining questions be allowed to stand . 
We need a greater focus on attracting some of the best and brightest , not just to business , but also to a public service that Canadians and public servants can be proud of . 
Currently , final determination of the payment of survival benefits can be delayed indefinitely when a survivor cannot be found . 
It belongs to parliamentarians to make those changes . 
There should have been enough time allocated for debate to take place in the House . 
This is where the problem exists . 
Fortunately the CPP rate is scheduled to stabilize in the year 2004 as a result of good government planning . 
I would like to ask a very short question . 
At a rate of 10 % , an amount of $ 33 billion will earn $ 3.3 billion . 
Under the current legislation investment of contributions is limited to government bonds . 
I wish the hon. member who uses a computer at his desk would put some of the research material in , maybe get on to the Internet and tap into the government ' s information .

Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
Mr. Speaker , the minister says " by the end of the month '' , but it would appear that the groundfish have arrived ahead of the minister . 
The minister has used parliament and the other place to negotiate with the Americans . 
FISHERIES

The total registered population for the Heiltsuk First Nation is 2,014 . 
The fourth amendment related to taxes .

The same is true of the bill before us today . 
They would then be able to stay in their communities and have a good quality of life . 
MacKay went as far as to actually recommend that these commitments be legally binding for the banks and for the directors of the banks . 
It will certainly add to the financial landscape of the country . 
PRIVATE MEMBERS ' BUSINESS 
In an attempt to address the alleged problem in the gasoline retail sector , the bill will unintentionally regulate all vertically integrated companies . 
I also wish to thank the hon. member for Regina - Lumsden - Lake Centre for his efforts in promoting Bill C - 235 , as well as John Holm , the MLA for Sackville - Cobequid , Nova Scotia , who we call the gas man , for his efforts in telling the Competition Bureau to become a watchdog on competition in gas sales and vertical integration instead of being a lap dog . 
Bill C - 235 does not deal just with gasoline retailers .

The Hon. Marcel Mass é ( on behalf of the Minister of the Environment ) moved : 
It is not , as the parliamentary secretary said , a veto for the provinces . 
These motions would mean a step backward and ought to be defeated. 
I will briefly discuss the Group No. 2 amendments brought forward by the minister . 
We dilute it further when we pass it on to the provinces , which in turn pass it on to somebody else . 
They were quick to look at the rights of the provincial jurisdictions and to have first right opportunities , but we have to take responsibility for the entire nation of Canada . 
Mr. Speaker , today we are speaking about Bill C - 32 , which deals with protection of the environment .

Has the government called for an emergency session of the security council to address this growing crisis ? 
Given the fact that the Reform Party is criticizing that period , why is it so eager to hop into bed with the Tory party which gave us those economic policies ? 
We have raised this issue with the highest authority of the Chinese government whenever we could . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is for the minister of the homeless . 
Madam Speaker , given the announcement yesterday with respect to the changes in Bill C - 55 , does the leader of the government in the House expect that Bill C - 55 will be coming back to the House before the summer recess ? 
The preamble contains 14 separate commitments and goals of the government . 
I am troubled that perhaps in some circumstances there may be some industrial concerns or some agricultural concerns . 
It cannot be done , as it has been done in the past , by more irrigation and more development of arable lands . 
The minister never did anything . 
" `` waste " means any solid , liquid or gaseous material or materials or a combination of them , discarded or intended to be discarded as useless and valueless , but excludes recyclable material. " 
The precautionary principle means that we act in a cautionary way to ensure the protection of the environment and human health where threats of serious or irreversible harm exists . 
We support that amendment as well . 
Why go back in time ? 
I guess it is a sign of the times .

On division . 
I long for the day when this totally unprincipled Liberal government is replaced by a governing party which will make these decisions by a free vote , reflecting the will of the people .

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
This measure is called the concordance rate . 
First , as stated previously , it is unfortunate that the government did not see fit to address the recommendations of the justice committee concerning amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act . 
It was simply an attempt to simplify and to put a more succinct definition forward when it comes to the implementation of some of the changes we will see as a result of Bill C - 79 . 
We will continue to talk to the government until it places the rights of victims above the rights of the criminals in our criminal justice system .

Certainly I am not going to hide the fact that if a company in my constituency was bidding on a $ 100 million contract and a parliamentary committee was holding hearings across the country on the project , you bet I would make submissions to the committee saying that the company was doing a great job and it would do a fine job if it got the contract .

Problematical mills for these three years add up to a total of 45 . 
No , we are now discussing Group No. 6 . 
But governments cannot act alone , and the duties of the federal government as set out in Bill C - 32 provide that it should encourage the participation of the people of Canada in the making of decisions that affect the environment , and facilitate the protection of the environment by the people of Canada . 
Mr. Paul Cr ê te ( Kamouraska - Rivi è re - du - Loup - T é miscouata - Les Basques , BQ ) : 
Otherwise , by turning the census into a political operation , this federal agency will lose its credibility . 
Will the Prime Minister commit his party and his caucus to the idea of a total phase - out of persistent toxins and reject the amendments that have been brought forward that reject the work of the committee which called for phase - out ? 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
When will the minister end the madness , display some common sense and cancel this ridiculous registration ? 
I respect Saskatchewan farmers . 
The petitioners are very concerned that families who decide that one of the parents will stay at home to raise their children instead of hiring someone else to do it should have tax discrimination . 
Otherwise , as we have said , we are going to have to vote against it . 
They do provide , however , sufficient time to outline 20 ways in which the bill is a significant improvement over the existing act , 20 ways in which the legislation will mean better protection of the environment and the health of Canadians . 
I have not seen any changes on that . 
We feel that these amendments , particularly those passed by the majority Liberal members in committee , are unacceptable . 
A while ago I mentioned the Yukon . 
We drink water . 
We will eventually have to face many rules , standards , and ways to meet them , a great deal of confusion and difficulty for the businesses in meeting them , and all sorts of legal challenges . 
This makes the whole issue even more problematic , because there is increasing awareness regarding the cleaning and the safety measures that are required. 
It was high time .

Twenty three thousand substances must be examined.

ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS 
The environment issues facing us today are being addressed somewhat in Bill C - 32 , which deals with pollution control and human health . 
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) : 
What the Bloc Quebecois deplores is that the federal government refuses to give legislative expression to its good intentions with regard to environmental harmonization and chooses instead to hide behind the centralizing screen of the Supreme Court of Canada . 
This is where the commitment to saving our farms , our soil and our environment must begin .

After what I have heard today I must say the government is falling far short of the commitments it has made . 
There is so much more that we could do on the environment that we are not doing . 
The next review of CEPA may not take place here . 
There are those who will wonder whether or not other nations have legislation . 
- there was no question that Westray management knew that the levels of methane underground at the coal mine were hazardous . 
The motion being presented is certainly worthy of note and interesting to consider . 
Federal government inspectors visit workplaces , respond to complaints , conduct investigations , prohibit access to workplaces deemed hazardous and can impose fines for non - compliance . 
We now know that such careless activity can ruin our beautiful planet . 
Children ' s health comes first . 
MILLENNIUM SCHOLARSHIPS 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais 
SENIORS MONTH 
Mr. Andr é Harvey ( Chicoutimi , PC ) : 
Is this the best way to defend the interests of Quebec , briefing us in the evening after the cases have already been argued ? 
My colleague , the Minister of Foreign Affairs , met last week with the Secretary of State for the United States , Madam Albright . 
First , a friend buys a money losing hotel from the Prime Minister ' s company and then receives nearly $ 1 million in grants and loans . 
This is a very major purchase . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Motion No. 43 
Motion No. 105 
Motion No. 155 
I will quote some of the witnesses . 
Other witnesses have alluded to these provisions of the bill prompting challenges under the charter of rights and freedoms if the privacy commissioner acted upon clauses 12 or 18 . 
It is difficult for us too . 
In short , Bill C - 54 as it stands now has too many flaws from the constitutional , democratic , and legal points of view , and it does not adequately protect personal information . 
I was intrigued with an ad I saw in a magazine on an airplane . 
Since the Constitution states clearly that those issues are under provincial jurisdiction , the Supreme Court of Canada will disallow the industry minister ' s bill , which will have been nothing but a loss of valuable time . 
On behalf of the member for New Brunswick Southwest , our caucus and myself , I urge the Minister of Health to refer the issue to the Standing Committee on Health . 
They often get into legal battles with private insurers and they have a higher rate of suicide . 
As a result , this is the best possible scenario in a situation where we can still continue to debate the issue at the committee level and have the House dispose of it . 
Introduction and first reading 
Mr. Rick Laliberte 
Hon. Don Boudria 
They call upon parliament to immediately stop Canada ' s involvement in the bombing campaign and to work toward a diplomatic solution before any more lives are needlessly and tragically lost . 
I would point something out for the minister ' s benefit . 
An hon. member : 
She is not responding to the challenge that has been raised in British Columbia that the government has violated sections 91 and 92 of the constitution . 
The federal or provincial government decides what it will give to aboriginals and this is simply a recognition of their distinct approach or culture . 
We are all intelligent people . 
Our common objective is to change the egregious situation which affects aboriginal people from coast to coast on and off reserve . 
They should be at least regionally based individuals with some connection to the area under consideration . 
I would ask the Chair to ask the member to apologize . 
Mr. Mike Scott : 
My riding in particular has several small aboriginal bands , and there are land claims involved. 
The majority of it , up to 80 % or 90 % of it , has been logged. 
He likened Indians living on aboriginal reserves to people living on south sea islands and being taken care of by their rich uncles . 
Will it require a more rigorous and more lengthy process to amend the treaty ? 
Paragraph 40 again refers to in the event of inconsistency . 
KOSOVO 
The hon. member for Churchill River . 
Mr. Speaker , not only does the peace agreement offer a true glimmer of hope , but it also means that the Yugoslav parliament has accepted , with a vote before its people , all of the conditions set by the G - 8 . 
Some hon. members : 
Mr. Lou Sekora ( Port Moody - Coquitlam - Port Coquitlam , Lib . ) : 
Canadians want to get to the bottom of this . 
I am sure we are all anxiously awaiting the re - election of the third consecutive Liberal government under the able leadership of the Prime Minister . 
I had many experiences in my previous life of aboriginal communities taking on responsibility for themselves . 
A budget would actually be approved in advance . 
This is a one of a kind treaty that reflects the unique needs and interests of the Nisga ' a . 
What the member is telling me is that it is okay to take from here to give to there without due process of law . 
Both of these groups have the right to vote . 
I believe the Nisga ' a agreement is something Canada should embrace . 
The treaty provides the Nisga ' a with a financial transfer of $ 190 million payable over 15 years . 
Is there something happening today that I am not aware of ? 
Whether we like it or not , if only two individuals have pictures on a ballot of from six to thirteen people and the others do not have pictures , it draws more attention to those two individuals . 
I consulted a number of them on this point , and I can tell you that everyone I consulted , working Monday to Friday and often on weekends with people who are illiterate , support with one voice the idea of having each candidate ' s photo on the ballot . 
On the issue of accessibility , all of us in the House support that . 
I hope the government will take a chance over the summer holidays to look at what it is doing and come back with a mandate from the people to do what the people want to solve this problem for young people . 
NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION WEEK 
Ms. H é l è ne Alarie 
One of our primary objectives has been to safeguard Canadian sovereignty . 
It seeks to broaden and expand the preclearance situation in the airports . 
I listened to Reform members , among others , speaking of the other place . 
On behalf of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons , who is the member of parliament for Kingston and the Islands , myself and our constituents , I send hearty congratulations and best wishes for ever success into the future . 
They simply do not believe in it . 
ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
That is moving fish to Canada . 
The hon. member , as the Vancouver Sun did this morning , should be congratulating the minister . 
It forces the government to do research on endocrine disrupters . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to raise a point of national concern today . 
Madam Speaker , I am pleased today to present two petitions signed by people from in and around the city of Edmonton , Alberta . 
Some hon. members : 
This modernization by amending the Carriage by Air Act is long overdue . 
I would not want to be dependent on the municipality I live in right now to be fair about the inheritance of the property I own by my children . 
Some of its members are very intelligent people . 
There are regions that are heavily dependent on fossil fuels , on coal - fired electrical generation and on the coal industry . 
The Reform Party supports the principle that the provinces should have exclusive jurisdiction over natural resources and that citizens of the provinces should all benefit from the development of those resources . 
Mr. Ian Murray ( Lanark - Carleton , Lib . ) : 
Apart from that we were being jerked by Centra Gas . 
Mr. Denis Coderre 
Mr. Randy White 
Mr. Antoine Dub é 
They will have to relive this all over again . 
It will not be retroactive . 
How do you want to vote ? 
Did hon. members know that there is no system to monitor the federations , and no assurance that taxpayers ' money will be properly managed and our athletes respected ? 
I hope this debate will at least have the effect of reviving the report of the Subcommittee on the Study of Sport in Canada , which had been shelved. 
I am one of the instigators of the boycott of the last movie , which was in English only and produced by Americans . 
We have to re - establish our priorities for amateur sports without a doubt and I have indicated the two areas . 
Should this be a responsibility of those provinces and cities that do not have an NHL team or should it be the responsibility of the the Montreal urban governments ? 
STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
FORCES OF LIBERATION 
Mr. Speaker , those arms get pretty short . 
Everyone can see that they are in conflict . 
Mr. Speaker , Wing Construction , an old and established Manitoba company , is more than $ 2 million in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy because of fraudulent actions by former Sagkeeng band chief Jerry Fontaine . 
Mr. Speaker , when someone sells shares , the transaction is not finally completed until something of value has been received for the shares . 
Mr. Speaker , not the one of today . 
Mr. Bill Gilmour ( Nanaimo - Alberni , Ref. ) : 
However , I suggest there is more we can do in terms of having a return from the aspect of gambling that stems from sport . 
Besides exchanging the flag of Canada for a fleur de lys , not much was said since the beginning . 
It takes nothing away from the pride the other amateur athletes in the riding of Prince Edward - Hastings and across Canada bring to us . 
I see great hope for that in the future . 
It is now the turn of the hon. member for Lac - Saint - Jean . 
Street hockey has been replaced by video games . 
At the same time the new initiatives would enhance the government ' s efforts related to access and equity for traditionally underrepresented groups including women , athletes with a disability and aboriginal people . 
I have seen young people in amateur sports who had participated in a competition and won a division or zone competition . 
If the federal government chooses to take a leadership role with the provinces and is willing to approach the ministries of education to work with the Canadian Olympic Association , I think that would be a fantastic partnership . 
Sport Canada makes available to athletes a number of tools to fully develop their talent and skills , including direct financial assistance through the athletes assistance program in the form of benefits and living and training allowances ; support to 38 national sports organizations to set up a high performance program ; support to 11 multi - sport / multi - service organizations such as the Coaching Association of Canada , the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport , the Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activities ; support to the hosting of high performance games , selected international sports events , and world championships held in Canada . 
We hear around the country about all the problems with health care . 
It will be done in the same way the EI fund was grabbed and taken away from those who are unemployed. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai 
Mr. John Williams 
Mr. Pierre Brien 
Concurrence in Vote 1 - Parliament 
Mr. Werner Schmidt ( Kelowna , Ref. ) : 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
Would we use the notwithstanding clause to defend the current definition of marriage ? 
I move : 
Does he also agree , presumably , that a single parent family in which there is only one woman raising children or one man raising children is a gender deprived family and similarly is a defective or a deficient family ? 
I am a bit bothered by the turn the debate is taking . 
In fact , those of us from the maritime provinces grew up knowing that when we splice the ends of a rope together , we say we marry them . 
The difficult aspect that I have with the motion and the wording of the motion is that it talks of the need to deal with this issue , which suggests that it is one of timeliness . 
There is more to marriage than that , but I believe very strongly that the issue is before the House just to create friction which does not necessarily have to be there at a time when there are many things of great importance to Canadians . 
Mr. Speaker , it is very obvious . 
The Minister of Justice , who spoke earlier today , announced that the government will support the motion because it reaffirms the existing laws of Canada . 
That is a totally irresponsible comment , that the Minister of Justice should not respect a decision made by the highest court of the land , the Supreme Court of Canada . 
It is that role which we hold very dear , which we put on a pedestal , of which we discriminate in favour . 
It was at a funeral held for a solider , a constituent of mine who was killed during a land mine exercise in Bosnia . 
It has been my experience and the experience of many others whom I have talked to , colleagues and numerous other people , that most have carefully thought about that commitment , some more than others . 
I think the fair conclusion is that if parliament does not decide these issues then the courts will take over . 
I stand , my colleague , to advise you that you are now about halfway through your speech . 
The winner came in with a message which is that absolutely nothing can stand in the way of people who agree it is time for political change . 
Mr. Speaker , in the resolution that will eventually be adopted by the United Nations security council there is provision for the disarmament of the KLA . 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien ( Prime Minister , Lib . ) : 
When people in my riding apply for grants available to all ridings with high unemployment , I do my duty as an MP and I hope that the member for Roberval does the same . 
I have been raising this issue with my officials and we are looking into solutions because we want to serve citizens as well as we can . 
We have also set aside money in the budget for rural health initiatives . 
It seems to me this will not go away . 
When he won , Mr. Hanrahan took time to warmly thank his students for their encouragement . 
It is my place to define the law to make sure that the rights of children are protected. 
Madam Speaker , I must say that I share the mystification of the deputy whip of the government when she said it is a mystery why we have to talk about this . 
How did you vote ? 
There may be a few ; there may be a few gays and lesbians around but I do not think they are in large numbers . 
Under the heading of family it states : 
Within that definition we need to be absolutely clear as to exactly what we want the courts and judges of this land to interpret when they have before them cases dealing with this matter . 
I believe that the results of today ' s vote will clearly state to the people of Canada that the courts have not changed the definition of marriage nor is it the intention of the government to change the definition of marriage . 
It happened so recently that I am surprised my colleagues across the way would not reflect upon it . 
Let us be clear . 
Often they are involved in their communities . 
Perhaps we will have to extend the debate . 
More specifically , under section 42 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , reforming the Senate would require the consent of at least seven provinces representing no less than 50 % of Canada ' s population . 
They have a right to think that way . 
When the constitution was written in 1867 it was modelled on the example of Westminster in London , England . 
We reached a compromise with the government that we would form a committee to address the situation , to bring some sanity and modern thinking , some accountability and governance into the management of the estimates . 
The Senate of Canada today is politically an illegitimate body , and that is what is creating the clash here . 
It is a sad commentary that 132 years after Confederation we are still living in a society where the elected representatives of the people are being held hostage by a group of 104 people who have no political legitimacy . 
I can hear him rattling his head from this far away . 
Why waste my vote ? 
We should unite in terms of getting rid of the status quo . 
The Reform Party did not support it . 
Instead , they voted against the Charlottetown accord . 
There are few countries around the world that are real democracies and of those there are few around the world that may boast of having their Houses appointed by the Prime Minister , appointments that are basely and blatantly partisan . 
That is one of the realities . 
That is totally improper . 
Members 
Mr. John Nunziata : 
YEAS 
Some hon. members : 
Some hon. members : 
Right Hon. Jean Chr é tien 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia - Leis 
The development of infrastructure and the petrochemical industry have transformed a barren land into one of the most advanced nations of the world . 
If the international Francophonie did not have any misgivings about including governments such as those of Quebec and New Brunswick , could it not recognize the Acadian people , the second francophone group in America , as a participant in the Agence de la Francophonie ? 
How can the government claim that the agreement is about areas of shared jurisdiction , when leading experts confirm that , on the contrary , it deals with areas that are exclusively provincial in jurisdiction ? 
He confirmed that the shares were sold before I became Prime Minister . 
Hon. Sheila Copps ( Minister of Canadian Heritage , Lib . ) : 
POINTS OF ORDER 
Mr. Nelson Riis ( Kamloops , Thompson and Highland Valleys , NDP ) : 
Question No. 239 - Mr. Jim Hart : 
I can also tell the hon. member that at that time we lost our argument as he is going to lose his today . 
I would like the House to hear what other people are saying about this magazine bill . 
Moreover it has become a source of national pride as the industry garners one prestigious national award after another . 
The key tax provisions of concern to U.S. publishers include the following terms , again as impacted by the amendments to this bill . 
Or does it intend to initiate negotiations on culture in some context other than the WTO ? 
The Minister of Canadian Heritage will say that there was 100 % of advertising revenue and we have given away 18 % and that it could have been much worse . 
I want to emphasize to all members that the bill is before the House as a constructive proposal. 
( i ) the question shall be put for disposal of the second reading stage after one or two members from each recognized party has spoken for a period of not more than twenty minutes per party ; 
One was to limit the scope of included products from all products to products intended for use by children . 
The first is the offence of leaving the scene of an accident to escape civil or criminal liability . 
I want to read this letter to the House . 
I say that because of the wording of the report , particularly with respect to what members , such as the member for T é miscamingue and I , were supposed to have said. 
I would not say that it never occurs or that people do not drink and drive in that fashion any longer . 
If we can give any gift to Canadians , if we can participate in an effort to educate and respond in a responsible way to drinking to prevent tragedies and further carnage on our highways , this is perhaps the best and most telling thing we can do . 
The Deputy Speaker : 
On division . 
What can we make of this one paragraph outlining American responsibilities ? 
It is not even clear . 
He and his wife have separate farming operations which include each possessing their own Canadian Wheat Board permit books , filing separate taxes and having separate NISA accounts . 
Bill C - 520 . 
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Speaker , as you can see from the size of this report , it represents a considerable amount of work which was done by committee members in a very short , compressed period of time . 
Mr. Speaker , it is an honour to present a petition , and particularly when you are in the chair today . 
It picked a fight and expended a tremendous amount of energy in an area which it knew it could not win . 
Mr. Speaker , the Reform Party was and still is , I believe , the only party that has resisted and said that it is dead against this agreement . 
These achievements , however , did not come without a cost . 
Once again we are experiencing the arrogance of this weak Liberal government with no vision . 
She stated that the merchant marines who served in the war have never had recognition nor have they had their pensions . 
I did say sometimes , especially when it stands for its principles . 
For instance , both on the far right and the left in the U.S. the protectionist movement is gaining steam and getting stronger . 
Those magazines with their large budgets and market penetration will be able to attract Canadian advertisers through the simple exercise of the law of supply and demand . 
Quite often , in order to protect ourselves from the sun , we wear a big hat called a Stetson . 
Mr. Speaker , I want to comment on some of the comments we heard from some of the Reform members this morning . 
People from all across the country are speaking out . 
Cultural expression reflecting the common and diverse experiences , observations and aspirations of the citizens of a nation state is central to the creation and maintenance of a shared sense of identity and the promotion of understanding among diverse elements resident within the same political boundaries . 
Mr. Speaker , I just wanted to correct the record . 
Mr. Bob Mills ( Red Deer , Ref. ) : 
That is exactly the reason I wanted the occasion at 3 o ' clock to make a statement extending congratulations to our soldiers who have done an excellent job there and to the Americans . 
The government time and again assured Canadians that our cultural identity and cultural sovereignty were not at risk and not up for negotiation , but later today when the House votes on the magazine bill the hollowness of those assurances will be exposed for all to see . 
This minister had a blood scandal that he did not handle very well . 
Mr. Speaker , last week the minister responsible for western diversification indicated that a new aid program could be in the works for waterlogged Manitoba and Saskatchewan farmers . 
The Speaker : 
But there is now cause for celebration : the war and destruction are over , and the era of peace and reconstruction is beginning . 
I hope that Canada will again assume its role as a leader in diplomacy and peace , and not as a leader in war . 
Time and time and time again we cave in to the American interests . 
The emotion expressed in the letters he has received is as powerful as any he ' s seen in his long political career in the B.C. legislature and the Senate . 
The Squamish nation has intervened on behalf of all signatory bands on the side of the federal government and against the B.C. Native Women ' s Society on the Bill C - 49 lawsuit . 
I will now turn to the issue of the land codes . 
The first nation members are required to vote on a community process for the development of rules and procedures for matrimonial property . 
I have some officials with me . 
Referring to the Minister of Canadian Heritage she said : 
This minister has shown over and over again , whether we are debating Bill C - 49 , the Nisga ' a treaty or other issues , that she does not have a fundamental understanding of what she is talking about . 
First , there is no indication of how cases of divorce and division of matrimonial property are to be dealt with within the 12 months following the community ratification of the land code . 
Miss Buffalo said that should not be an excuse . 
I appreciate the intervention of the hon. member for Lakeland . 
For years and years and years the government front bench , whether it is the Conservatives or the Liberals , has controlled Private Members ' Business . 
The Acting Speaker ( Mr. McClelland ) : 
We are supportive of this private member ' s bill , which deals with an amendment to the Income Tax Act , to allow the deduction of expenses for mechanic tools required in employment . 
We need to ensure that when any tax relief is provided it is only for items required as a condition of employment and not for personal use . 
Others can claim these expenses on their income tax returns , but mechanics cannot . 
Maybe the parliamentary secretary could answer those questions for the people in my riding who are very concerned about this issue and who would like to have the answer . 
It was the 1998 budget in which the government moved to narrow the gap between renewables and non - renewables by extending the benefits and the $ 150 million . 
It being 2.19 p.m. , the House stands adjourned until Monday , September 20 , 1999 at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Orders 28 ( 2 ) and 24 ( 1 ) . 
Mr. Beno î t Sauvageau 
Some hon. members : 
She was well known and very involved in her community . 
Clearly , the PQ government has no intention of working to improve the Canadian social union . 
Unfortunately , another point was made : 
Mr. Speaker , the lawsuit to which the hon. member referred that was settled involved Mr. Mulroney absolutely dropping his claim for damages . 
In the budget just brought down , an additional $ 37 million was set aside for the RCMP . 
Mr. Speaker , my question is to the Deputy Prime Minister . 
The Speaker : 
Mr. Dick Proctor ( Palliser , NDP ) moved : 
The first thing this motion would need is an amendment to say that any of us who dare to stand for public office , who dare to stick our faces in the cameras or our mouths into the microphones , are open game . 
He should be appealing , in my sense , to fair play , to decency and to honour . 
The Deputy Speaker :
